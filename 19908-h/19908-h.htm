<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p>Some twenty years ago the ambition seized me
to write a History of Scandinavian Literature. I
scarcely realized then what an enormous amount
of reading would be required to equip me for this
task. My studies naturally led me much beyond
the scope of my original intention. There was a
fascination in the work which lured me perpetually
on, and made me explore with a constantly increasing
zest the great literary personalities of Norway,
Sweden, and Denmark. Thus my chapter on Henrik
Ibsen grew into a book of three hundred and
seventeen pages, which was published a year ago,
and must be regarded as supplementary to the
present volume. The chapter on Bj&ouml;rnstjerne
Bj&ouml;rnson was in danger of expanding to similar
proportions, and only the most heroic condensation
saved it from challenging criticism as an independent
work. As regards Norway and Denmark,
I have endeavored to select all the weightiest and
most representative names. The Swedish authors
Johan Ludvig Runeberg, Mrs. Edgren, and August
Strindberg, and the Dane Oehlenschlaeger,
necessity has compelled me to reserve for a future
volume.</p>

<h2>BJ&Ouml;RNSTJERNE BJ&Ouml;RNSON</h2>


<h3>I</h3>

<p>Bj&ouml;rnstjerne Bj&ouml;rnson is the first
Norwegian poet who can in any sense be
called national. The national genius, with its limitations
as well as its virtues, has found its living
embodiment in him. Whenever he opens his mouth
it is as if the nation itself were speaking. If he
writes a little song, hardly a year elapses before its
phrases have passed into the common speech of the
people; composers compete for the honor of interpreting
it in simple, Norse-sounding melodies,
which gradually work their way from the drawing-room
to the kitchen, the street, and thence
out over the wide fields and highlands of Norway.
His tales, romances, and dramas express collectively
the supreme result of the nation's experience,
so that no one to-day can view Norwegian life
or Norwegian history except through their medium.
The bitterest opponent of the poet (for like every
strong personality he has many enemies) is thus
no less his debtor than his warmest admirer. His
speech has stamped itself upon the very language
and given it a new ring, a deeper resonance. His<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
thought fills the air, and has become the unconscious
property of all who have grown to manhood
and womanhood since the day when his titanic
form first loomed up on the horizon of the North.
It is not only as their first and greatest poet that
the Norsemen love and hate him, but also as a
civilizer in the widest sense. But like Kadmus,
in Greek myth, he has not only brought with him
letters, but also the dragon-teeth of strife, which
it is to be hoped will not sprout forth in armed
men.</p>

<p>A man's ancestry and environment, no doubt,
account in a superficial manner for his appearance
and mental characteristics. Having the man, we
are able to trace the germs of his being in the past
of his race and his country; but, with all our
science we have not yet acquired the ingenuity to
predict the man&mdash;to deduce him <i>a priori</i> from the
tangle of determining causes which enveloped his
birth. It seems beautifully appropriate in the
Elder Edda that the god-descended hero Helge
the V&ouml;lsung should be born amid gloom and terror
in a storm which shakes the house, while the
Norns&mdash;the goddesses of fate&mdash;proclaim in the
tempest his tempestuous career. Equally satisfactory
it appears to have the modern champion of
Norway&mdash;the typical modern Norseman&mdash;born on
the bleak and wild Dovre Mountain,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> where there
is winter eight months of the year and cold
weather during the remaining four. The parish of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
Kvikne, in Oesterdalen, where his father, the Reverend
Peder Bj&ouml;rnson, held a living, had a bad
reputation on account of the unruly ferocity and
brutal violence of the inhabitants. One of the Reverend
Peder Bj&ouml;rnson's recent predecessors never
went into his pulpit, unarmed; and another fled
for his life. The peasants were not slow in intimating
to the new pastor that they meant to have
him mind his own business and conform to the
manners and customs of the parish; but there they
reckoned without their host. The reverend gentleman
made short work of the opposition. He enforced
the new law of compulsory education without
heeding its unpopularity; and when the champion
fighter of the valley came as the peasants'
spokesman to take him to task in summary fashion,
he found himself, before he was aware of it,
at the bottom of the stairs, where he picked himself
up wonderingly and promptly took to his
heels.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> December 8, 1832.</p></div>

<p>During the winter the snow reached up to the
second-story windows of the parsonage; and the
servants had to tunnel their way to the storehouse
and the stables. The cold was so intense that the
little Bj&ouml;rnstjerne thought twice before touching a
door knob, as his fingers were liable to stick to the
metal. When he was six years old, however, his father
was transferred to Romsdal, which is, indeed,
a wild and grandly picturesque region; but far
less desolate than Dovre. "It lies," says Bj&ouml;rnson,
"broad&mdash;bosomed between two confluent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
fjords, with a green mountain above, cataracts and
homesteads on the opposite shore, waving meadows
and activity in the bottom of the valley; and all
the way out toward the ocean, mountains with
headland upon headland running out into the
fjord and a large farm upon each."</p>

<p>The feeling of terror, the crushing sense of guilt
which Bj&ouml;rnson has so strikingly portrayed in the
first chapters of "In God's Way," were familiar
to his own childhood. In every life, as in every
race, the God of fear precedes the God of love.
And in Northern Norway, where nature seems so
tremendous and man so insignificant, no boy escapes
these phantoms of dread which clutch him
with icy fingers. But as a counterbalancing force
in the young Bj&ouml;rnson, we have his confidence in
the strength and good sense of his gigantic father,
who could thrash the strongest champion in the
parish. He used to stand in the evening on the
beach "and gaze at the play of the sunshine upon
fjord and mountain, until he wept, as if he had
done something wrong. Now he would suddenly
stop in this or that valley, while running on
skees, and stand spell-bound by its beauty and a
longing which he could not comprehend, but
which was so great that in the midst of the highest
joy he was keenly conscious of a sense of confinement
and sorrow."<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> "We catch a glimpse in
these childish memories," says Mr. Nordahl Rolfsen,
"of the remarkable character, we are about to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
depict: Being the son of a giant, he is ever ready
to strike out with a heavy hand, when he thinks
that anyone is encroaching upon what he deems
the right. But this same pugnacious man, whom
it is so hard to overcome, can be overwhelmed by
an emotion and surrender himself to it with his
whole being."</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> Nordahl Rolfsen: Norske Digtere, pp. 450, 451.</p></div>

<p>At the age of twelve Bj&ouml;rnson was sent to the
Latin school at Molde, where, however, his progress
was not encouraging. He was one of those
thoroughly healthy and headstrong boys who are
the despair of ambitious mothers, and whom
fathers (when the futility of educational chastisement
has been finally proved) are apt to regard
with a resigned and half-humorous regret.
His dislike of books was instinctive, hearty, and
uncompromising. His strong, half-savage boy-nature
could brook no restraints, and looked longingly
homeward to the wide mountain plains, the
foaming rivers where the trout leaped in the summer
night, and the calm fjord where you might
drift blissfully along, as it were, suspended in the
midst of the vast, blue, ethereal space. And when
the summer vacation came, with its glorious freedom
and irresponsibility, he would roam at his
own sweet will through forest and field, until
hunger and fatigue forced him to return to his
father's parsonage.</p>

<p>After several years of steadily unsuccessful study,
Bj&ouml;rnson at last passed the so-called <i>examen artium</i>,
which admitted him to the University of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
Christiania. He was now a youth of large, almost
athletic frame, with a handsome, striking face, and
a pair of blue eyes which no one is apt to forget
who has ever looked into them. There was a certain
grand simplicity and <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i> in his manner,
and an exuberance of animal spirits which must
have made him an object of curious interest among
his town-bred fellow-students. But his University
career was of brief duration. All the dimly fermenting
powers of his rich nature were now beginning
to clarify, the consciousness of his calling began
to assert itself, and the demand for expression
became imperative. His literary <i>d&eacute;but</i> was an historic
drama entitled "Valborg," which was accepted
for representation by the directors of the
Christiania Theatre, and procured for its author a
free ticket to all theatrical performances; it was,
however, never brought on the stage, as Bj&ouml;rnson,
having had his eyes opened to its defects, withdrew
it of his own accord.</p>

<p>At this time the Norwegian stage was almost entirely
in the hands of the Danes, and all the more
prominent actors were of Danish birth. Theatrical
managers drew freely on the dramatic treasures
of Danish literature, and occasionally, to replenish
the exchequer, reproduced a French comedy or
farce, whose epigrammatic pith and vigor were
more than half-spoiled in the translation. The
drama was as yet an exotic in Norway; it had no
root in the national soil, and could accordingly in
no respect represent the nation's own struggles<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
and aspirations. The critics themselves, no doubt,
looked upon it merely as a form of amusement, a
thing to be wondered and stared at, and to be dismissed
from the mind as soon as the curtain
dropped. Bj&ouml;rnson, whose patriotic soul could
not endure the thought of this abject foreign dependence,
ascribed all the existing abuses to the
predominance of the Danish element, and in a
series of vehement articles attacked the Danish
actors, managers, and all who were in any way responsible
for the unworthy condition of the national
stage. In return he reaped, as might have
been expected, an abundant harvest of abuse, but
the discussion he had provoked furnished food for
reflection, and the rapid development of the Norwegian
drama during the next decade is, no doubt,
largely traceable to his influence.</p>

<p>The liberty for which he had yearned so long,
Bj&ouml;rnson found at the International Students' Reunion
of 1856. Then the students of the Norwegian
and Danish Universities met in Upsala,
where they were received with grand festivities by
their Swedish brethren. Here the poet caught
the first glimpse of a greater and freer life than
moved within the narrow horizon of the Norwegian
capital. This gay and careless student-life, this
cheerful abandonment of all the artificial shackles
which burden one's feet in their daily walk through
a bureaucratic society, the temporary freedom
which allows one without offence to toast a prince
and hug a count to one's bosom&mdash;all this had its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
influence upon Bj&ouml;rnson's sensitive nature; it
filled his soul with a happy intoxication and with
confidence in his own strength. And having once
tasted a life like this he could no more return to
what he had left behind him.</p>

<p>The next winter we find him in Copenhagen,
laboring with an intensity of creative ardor which
he had never known before. His striking appearance,
the pithy terseness of his speech, and a certain
<i>na&iuml;ve</i> self-assertion and impatience of social
restraints made him a notable figure in the polite
and somewhat effeminate society of the Danish
capital. There was a general expectation at that
time that a great poet was to come, and although
Bj&ouml;rnson had as yet published nothing to justify
the expectation, he found the public of Copenhagen
ready to recognize in him the man who was to
rouse the North from its long intellectual torpor,
and usher in a new era in its literature. It is
needless to say that he did not discourage this belief,
for he himself fervently believed that he
would before long justify it. The first proof of his
strength he gave in the tale "Synn&ouml;ve Solbakken"
(Synn&ouml;ve Sunny-Hill), which he published in
an illustrated weekly, and afterward in book-form.
It is a very unpretending little story, idyllic in
tone, but realistic in its coloring, and redolent of
the pine and spruce and birch of the Norwegian
highlands.</p>

<p>It had been the fashion in Norway since the
nation regained its independence to interest one's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
self in a lofty, condescending way in the life of the
peasantry. A few well-meaning persons, like the
poet Wergeland, had labored zealously for their
enlightenment and the improvement of their economic
condition; but, except in the case of such
single individuals, no real and vital sympathy and
fellow-feeling had ever existed between the upper
and the lower strata of Norwegian society. And
as long as the fellow-feeling is wanting, this zeal
for enlightenment, however laudable its motive, is
not apt to produce lasting results. The peasants
view with distrust and suspicion whatever comes
to them from their social superiors, and the so-called
"useful books," which were scattered
broadcast over the land, were of a tediously didactic
character, and, moreover, hardly adapted to
the comprehension of those to whom they were
ostensibly addressed. Wergeland himself, with all
his self-sacrificing ardor, had but a vague conception
of the real needs of the people, and, as far as
results were concerned, wasted much of his valuable
life in his efforts to improve, edify and instruct
them. It hardly occurred to him that the
culture of which he and his colleagues were the
representatives was itself a foreign importation,
and could not by any violent process be ingrafted
upon the national trunk, which drew its strength
from centuries of national life, history, and tradition.
That this peasantry, whom the <i>bourgeoisie</i>
and the aristocracy of culture had been wont to
regard with half-pitying condescension, were the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
real representatives of the Norse nation; that they
had preserved through long years of tyranny and
foreign oppression the historic characteristics of
their Norse forefathers, while the upper classes
had gone in search of strange gods, and bowed
their necks to the foreign yoke; that in their
veins the old strong saga-life was still throbbing
with vigorous pulse-beats&mdash;this was the lesson
which Bj&ouml;rnson undertook to teach his countrymen,
and a very fruitful lesson it has proved to
be. It has inspired the people with renewed
courage, it has turned the national life into fresh
channels, and it has revolutionized national politics.</p>

<p>To be sure all this was not the result of the
idyllic little tale which marked the beginning of
his career. But this little tale, although no trace
of what the Germans call "tendency" is to be
found in it, is still significant as being the poet's
first indirect manifesto, and as such distinctly
foreshadowing the path which he has since followed.</p>

<p>First, in its purely literary aspect, "Synn&ouml;ve
Solbakken" was strikingly novel. The author did
not, as his predecessors had done, view the people
from the exalted pedestal of superior culture; not
as a subject for benevolent preaching and charitable
condescension, but as a concrete phenomenon,
whose <i>raison d'&eacute;tre</i> was as absolute and indisputable
as that of the <i>bourgeoisie</i> or the bureaucracy
itself. He depicted their soul-struggles and
the incidents of their daily life with a loving<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
minuteness and a vivid realism hitherto unequalled
in the literature of the North. He did not, like
Auerbach, construct his peasant figures through
laborious reflection, nor did he attempt by anxious
psychological analysis to initiate the reader into
their processes of thought and emotion. He simply
depicted them as he saw and knew them. Their
feelings and actions have their immediate, self-evident
motives in the characters themselves, and
the absence of analysis on the author's part gives
an increased energy and movement to the story.</p>

<p>Mr. Nordahl Rolfsen relates, <i>&agrave; propos</i> of the reception
which was accorded Bj&ouml;rnson's first book,
the following amusing anecdote:</p>

<p>"'Synn&ouml;ve Solbakken' was printed, and its
author was anxious to have his friends read it.
But not one of them could be prevailed upon. At
last a comrade was found who was persuaded to
attack it on the promise of a bottle of punch. He
entered Bj&ouml;rnson's den, got a long pipe which he
filled with tobacco, undressed himself completely&mdash;for
it was a hot day&mdash;flung himself on the bed, and
began to read. Bj&ouml;rnson sat in the sofa, breathless
with expectation. Leaf after leaf was turned;
not a smile, not a single encouraging word! The
young poet had good reason to regard the battle as
lost. At last the pipe, the bottle, and the book
were finished. Then the merciless Stoic rose and
began to dress, and the following little exclamation
escaped him: 'That is, the devil take me, the
best book I have read in all my life.'"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>Bj&ouml;rnson's style was no less novel than his
theme. It may or it may not have been consciously
modelled after the saga style, to which, however,
it bears an obvious resemblance. In his early
childhood, while he lived among the peasants, he
became familiar with their mode of thought and
speech, and it entered into his being, and became
his own natural mode of expression. There is in
his daily conversation a certain grim directness,
and a laconic weightiness, which give an air of importance
and authority even to his simplest utterances.
This tendency to compression frequently
has the effect of obscurity, not because his thought
is obscure, but rather because energetic brevity of
expression has fallen into disuse, and even a Norse
public, long accustomed to the wordy diffuseness
of latter-day bards, have in part lost the faculty
to comprehend the genius of their own language.
As a Danish critic wittily observed: "Bj&ouml;rnson's
language is but one step removed from pantomime."</p>

<p>In 1858 Bj&ouml;rnson assumed the directorship of
the theatre in Bergen, and there published his second
tale, "Arne," in which the same admirable
self-restraint, the same implicit confidence in the
intelligence of his reader, the same firm-handed
decision and vigor in the character-drawing, in
fact, all the qualities which delighted the public
in "Synn&ouml;ve Solbakken," were found in an intensified
degree.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, Bj&ouml;rnson had also made his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
<i>d&eacute;but</i> as a dramatist. In the year 1858 he had
published two dramas, "Mellem Slagene" (Between
the Battles) and "Halte-Hulda" (Limping
Hulda) both of which deal with national subjects,
taken from the old sagas. As in his tales he had
endeavored to concentrate into a few strongly defined
types the modern folk-life of the North, so
in his dramas the same innate love of his nationality
leads him to seek the typical features of his
people, as they are revealed in the historic chieftains
of the past.</p>

<p>"Between the Battles" is a dramatic episode
rather than a drama. During the civil war between
King Sverre and King Magnus in the twelfth century,
the former visits in disguise a hut upon the
mountains where a young warrior, Halvard Gjaela
and Inga, his beloved, are living together. The
long internecine strife has raised the hand of father
against son, and of brother against brother. Halvard
sympathizes with Sverre; Inga, who hates
the king because he has burned her father's farm,
is a partisan of Magnus. In the absence of her
lover she goes to the latter's camp and brings back
with her a dozen warriors for the purpose of capturing
Halvard, and thereby preventing him from
joining the enemy. Sverre discovers the warriors,
whom she has hidden in the cow-stable, and persuading
them that he is a spy for King Magnus
sends two of them to his own army for reinforcements.
In the meanwhile he reconciles the estranged
lovers, makes peace between them and Inga's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
father, and finally, in the last scene, as his men
arrive, is recognized as the king.</p>

<p>This is, of course, a venerable <i>coup de th&eacute;&acirc;tre</i>.
Whatever novelty there is in the play must be
sought, not in the situations, but in the pithy and
laconic dialogue, which has a distinct national coloring.
This was not the amiable diffuseness of
Oehlenschlaeger, who had hitherto dominated the
Norwegian as well as the Danish stage; and yet it
did not by any means represent so complete a
breach with the traditions of the romantic drama
as was claimed by Bj&ouml;rnson's admirers. The fresh
naturalness and absence of declamation were a
gain, no doubt; but there are yet several notes
remaining which have the well-known romantic
cadence. "Between the Battles," though too
slight to be called an achievement, was accepted
as a pledge of achievement in future.</p>

<p>Bj&ouml;rnson's next drama "Limping Hulda"
("Halte-Hulda") (1858) was a partial fulfilment
of this pledge. If it is not high tragedy, in the
ancient sense, it is of the stuff that tragedy is
made of. Hulda is an impressive stage figure in
her demoniac passion and tiger-like tenderness.
Though I doubt if Bj&ouml;rnson has, in this type,
caught the soul of a Norse woman of the saga age,
he has come much nearer to catching it than any
of his predecessors. If Gudrun Osvif's Daughter,
of the Laxdoela Saga, was his model, he has modernized
her considerably, and thereby made her
more intelligible to modern readers. Like her,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>
Hulda causes the murder of the man she loves;
and there is a fateful spell about her beauty which
brings death to whomsoever looks too long upon
it. Though ostensibly a saga-drama, the harshness
and grim ferocity of that sanguinary period
are softened; and a romantic illumination pervades
the whole action. A certain lyrical effusiveness
in the love passages (which is alien to all
Bj&ouml;rnson's later works) hints at the influence of
the Danish Romanticists, and particularly Oehlenschlaeger.</p>

<p>It would be unfair, perhaps, to take the author
to task because this youthful drama exhibits no remarkable
subtlety in its conception of character.
It contains no really great living figure who stands
squarely upon his feet and lingers in the memory.
A certain half-rhetorical impulse carries you along;
and the external effectiveness of the situations
keeps the interest on the alert. For all that
"Limping Hulda," like its predecessors and its
successors, tended to stimulate powerfully the national
spirit, which was then asserting itself in
every department of intellectual activity. Thus a
national theatre had, by the perseverance and generosity
of Ole Bull, been established in his native
city, Bergen; and it was almost a matter of course
that an effort should be made to identify Bj&ouml;rnson
with an enterprise which accorded so well with his
own aspirations. His connection with the Norwegian
Theatre of Bergen was, however, not of long
duration, for though your enthusiasm may be ever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
so great it is a thankless task to act as "artistic
director" of a stage in a town which is neither artistic
enough nor large enough to support a playhouse
with a higher aim than that of furnishing
ephemeral amusement. From Bergen he was
called to the editorship of <i>Aftenbladet</i> (The Evening
Journal), the second political daily of Christiania,
and continued there with hot zeal and eloquence
his battle for "all that is truly Norse."</p>

<p>But a brief experience sufficed to convince him
that daily journalism was not his <i>forte</i>. He was
and is too indiscreet, precipitate, credulous, and
inconsiderately generous to be a successful editor.
If a paper could be conducted on purely altruistic
principles, and without reference to profits, there
would be no man fitter to occupy an editorial
chair. For as an inspiring force, as a radiating
focus of influence, his equal is not to be encountered
"in seven kingdoms round." However, this
inspiring force could reach a far larger public
through published books than through the columns
of a newspaper. It was therefore by no
means in a regretful frame of mind that he descended
from the editorial tripod, and in the spring
of 1860 started for Italy. Previous to his departure
he published, through the famous house of
Gyldendal, in Copenhagen, a volume which, it is no
exaggeration to say, has become a classic of Norwegian
literature. It bears the modest title "Smaa-stykker"
(Small Pieces), but it contains, in spite of
its unpretentiousness, some of Bj&ouml;rnson's noblest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
work. I need only mention the masterly tale "The
Father," with its sobriety and serene strength. I
know but one other instance<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> of so great tragedy,
told in so few and simple words. "Arne," "En
Glad Gut" (A Happy Boy), and the amusing dialect
story, "Ei Faarleg Friing" (A Dangerous
Wooing), also belong to this delightful collection.
These little masterpieces of concise story-telling
have been included in the popular two-volume edition
of "Fort&auml;llinger," which contains also "The
Fisher-maiden" (1867-68), the exquisite story,
"The Bridal March" (1872), originally written as
text to three of Tidemand's paintings, and a vigorous
bit of disguised autobiography, "Blakken,"
of which not the author but a horse is the ostensible
hero.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> Austin Dobson's poem, "The Cradle."</p></div>

<p>The descriptive name for all these tales, except
the last, is idyl. It was, indeed, the period when
all Europe (outside the British empire) was viewing
the hardy sons of the soil through poetic spectacles.
In Germany Auerbach had, in his "Black
Forest Village Tales" (1843, 1853, 1854), discarded
the healthful but unflattering realism of
Jeremias Gotthelf (1797-1854), and chosen, with
a half-didactic purpose, to contrast the peasant's
honest rudeness and straightforwardness with the
refined sophistication and hypocrisy of the higher
classes. George Sand, with her beautiful Utopian
genius, poured forth a torrent of rural narrative
of a crystalline limpidity ("Mouny Robin," "La<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
Mare au Diable," "La Petite Fadette," etc., 1841-1849),
which is as far removed from the turbid
stream of Balzac ("Les Paysans") and Zola ("La
Terre"), as Paradise is from the Inferno. There
is an echo of Rousseau's gospel of nature in all
these tales, and the same optimistic delusion regarding
"the people" for which the eighteenth
century paid so dearly. The painters likewise
caught the tendency, and with the same thorough-going
conscientiousness as their brethren of the
quill, disguised coarseness as strength, bluntness
as honesty, churlishness as dignity. What an
idyllic sweetness there is, for instance, in Tidemand's
scenes of Norwegian peasant life! What a
<i>spirituelle</i> and movingly sentimental note in the
corresponding German scenes of Knaus and H&uuml;bner,
and, <i>longo intervallo</i>, Meyerheim and Meyer
von Bremen. Not a breath of the broad humor
of Teniers and Van Ostade in these masters;
scarcely a hint of the robust animality and clownish
jollity with which the clear-sighted Dutchmen
endowed their rural revellers. Though pictorial
art has not, outside of Russia (where the great and
unrivalled Riepin paints the peasant with the
brush as remorselessly as Tolsto&iuml; and Dostoyefski
with the pen), kept pace with the realistic movement
in literature, yet there is no lack of evidence
that the rose-colored tinge is vanishing even from
the painter's spectacles; and such uncompromising
veracity as that of Millet and Courbet, which
the past generation despised, is now hailed with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
acclaim in such masters as Bastien-Lepage, Dagnan-Bouveret,
and the Scandinavians, Kristian
Krog and Anders Zorn.</p>

<p>Bj&ouml;rnson is, however, temperamentally averse to
that modern naturalism which insists upon a minute
fidelity to fact without reference to artistic
values. His large and spacious mind has a Southern
exposure, and has all "its windows thrown
wide open to the sun." A sturdy optimism, which
is prone to believe good of all men, unless they
happen to be his political antagonists, inclines him
to overlook what does not fit into his own scheme
of existence. And yet no one can say that, as presentations
of Norwegian peasant life, "Synn&ouml;ve,"
"Arne," "The Bridal March," etc., are untrue,
though, indeed, one could well imagine pictures
in very much sombrer colors which might lay a
valider claim to veracity. Kielland's "Laboring
People," and Kristian Elster's "A Walk to the
Cross" and "Kjeld Horge," give the reverse of
the medal of which Bj&ouml;rnson exhibits the obverse.
These authors were never in any way
identified with "the people," and could not help
being struck with many of the rude and unbeautiful
phases of rural existence; while Bj&ouml;rnson, who
sprang directly from the peasantry, had the pride
and intelligence of kinship, and was not yet lifted
far enough above the life he depicted to have acquired
the cultivated man's sense of condescension
and patronizing benevolence. He was but one
generation removed from the soil; and he looked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
with a strong natural sympathy and affectionate
predilection upon whatever reminded him of this
origin. If he had been a peasant, however, he
could never have become the wonderful chronicler
that he is. It is the elevation, slight though it
be, which enables him to survey the fields in which
his fathers toiled and suffered. Or, to quote Mr.
Rolfsen: "Bj&ouml;rnson is the son of a clergyman;
he has never himself personally experienced the
peasant's daily toil and narrow parochial vision.
He has felt the power of the mountains over his
mind, and been filled with longing, as a grand
emotion, but the contractedness of the spiritual
horizon has not tormented him. He has not to
take that into account when he writes. During
the tedious school-days, his beautiful Romsdal
valley lay waiting for him, beckoning him home
at every vacation&mdash;always alluring and radiant,
with an idyllic shimmer."</p>

<p>Hence, no doubt, his sunny poetic vision which
unconsciously idealizes. Just as in daily intercourse
he displays a positive genius for drawing
out what is good in a man, and brushes away as of
small account what does not accord with his own
conception of him, nay, in a measure, forces him to
be as he believes him to be, so every character in
these early tales seems to bask in the genial glow of
his optimism. The farm Solbakken (Sunny Hill)
lies on a high elevation, where the sun shines from
its rise to its setting, and both Synn&ouml;ve and her
parents walk about in this still and warm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
illumination. They are all good, estimable people, and
their gentle piety, without any tinge of fanaticism,
invests them with a quiet dignity. The
sterner and hardier folk at Granliden (Pine Glen)
have a rugged honesty and straightforwardness
which, in connection with their pithy and laconic
speech, makes them less genial, but no less typically
Norse. They have a distinct atmosphere
and spinal columns that keep them erect, organic,
and significant. Even reprehensible characters
like Aslak and Nils Tailor (in "Arne")
have a certain claim upon our sympathy, the former
as a helpless victim of circumstance, the latter
as a suppressed and perverted genius.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1860 Bj&ouml;rnson went abroad and
devoted three years to foreign travel, spending the
greater part of his time in Italy. From Rome he
sent home the historical drama "King Sverre"
(1861), which is one of his weakest productions.
It is written in blank verse, with occasional rhymes
in the more impressive passages. Of dramatic interest
in the ordinary sense, there is but little. It
is a series of more or less animated scenes, from
the period of the great civil war (1130-1240), connected
by the personality of Sverre. Under the
mask, however, of medi&aelig;val history, the author
preaches a political sermon to his own contemporaries.
Sverre, as the champion of the common
people against the tribal aristocracy, and the wily
Bishop Nicholas as the representative of the latter
become, as it were, permanent forces, which have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
continued their battle to the present day. There
can be no doubt that Bj&ouml;rnson, whose sympathies
are strongly democratic, permitted the debate between
the two to become needlessly didactic, and
strained historical verisimilitude by veiled allusions
to contemporaneous conditions. Greatly
superior is his next drama, "Sigurd Slembe"<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
(1862).</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> An English version of "Sigurd Slembe" has been published
by William Morton Payne (Boston, 1888).</p></div>

<p>The story of the brave and able pretender, Sigurd
Slembe, in his struggle with the vain and
mean-spirited king, Harold Gille, is the theme of
the dramatic trilogy. Bj&ouml;rnson attempts to give
the spiritual development of Sigurd from the moment
he becomes acquainted with his royal birth
until his final destruction. From a frank and
generous youth, who is confident that he is born
for something great, he is driven by the treachery,
cruelty, and deceit of his brother, the king, into
the position of a desperate outlaw and guerilla.
The very first scene, in the church of St. Olaf,
where the boy confides to the saint, in a tone of
<i>bonne camaraderie</i>, his joy at having conquered, in
wrestling, the greatest champion in the land, gives
one the key-note to his character:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Now only listen to me, saintly Olaf!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To-day I whipped young Beintein! Beintein was<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The strongest man in Norway. Now am I!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now I can walk from Lindesn&auml;s and on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Up to the northern boundary of the snow,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">For no one step aside or lift my hat.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There where I am, no man hath leave to fight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To make a tumult, threaten, or to swear&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Peace everywhere! And he who wrong hath suffered<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall justice find, until the laws shall sing.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as before the great have whipped the small,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So will I help the small to whip the great.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now I can offer counsel at the Thing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now to the king's board I can boldly walk<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sit beside him, saying 'Here am I!'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The exultation in victory which speaks in every
line of this opening monologue marks the man
who, in spite of the obscurity of his origin, feels
his right to be first, and who, in this victory, celebrates
the attainment of his birthright. Equally
luminous by way of characterization is his exclamation
to St. Olaf when he hears that he is King
Magnus Barefoot's son:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Then we are kinsmen, Olaf, you and I!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>According to Norwegian law at that time, every
son of a king was entitled to his share of the kingdom,
and Sigurd's first impulse is to go straight to
Harold Gille and demand his right. His friend
Koll Saebj&ouml;rnson persuades him, however, to
abandon this hopeless adventure, and gives him a
ship with which he sails to the Orient, takes part
in many wars, and gains experience and martial renown.</p>

<p>The second part of the trilogy deals with Sigurd's
sojourn at the Orkneys, where he interferes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
in the quarrel between the Earls Harold and
Paul. The atmosphere of suspicion, insecurity, and
gloom which hangs like a portentous cloud over
these scenes is the very same which blows toward
us from the pages of the sagas. Bj&ouml;rnson has
gazed deeply into the heart of Northern paganism,
and has here reproduced the heroic anarchy
which was a necessary result of the code permitting
the individual to avenge his own wrongs.
The two awful women, Helga and Frakark, the
mother and the aunt of the earls, are types which
are constantly met with in the saga. It is a long-recognized
fact that women, under lawless conditions,
develop the wildest extremes of ambition,
avarice, and blood-thirstiness, and taunt the men
with their weak scruples. These two furies of the
Orkneys plot murder with an infernal coolness,
which makes Lady Macbeth a kind-hearted woman
by comparison. They recognize in Sigurd a man
born for leadership; determine to use him for the
furtherance of their plans, and to get rid of him,
by fair means or foul, when he shall have accomplished
his task. But Sigurd is too experienced
a chieftain to walk into this trap. While appearing
to acquiesce, he plays for stakes of his own, but
in the end abandons all in disgust at the death of
Earl Harold, who intentionally puts on the poisoned
shirt, prepared for his brother. There is no
great and monumental scene in this part which engraves
itself deeply upon the memory. The love
scenes with Audhild, the young cousin of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
earls, are incidental and episodical, and exert no
considerable influence either upon Sigurd's character
or upon the development of the intrigue.
Historically they are well and realistically conceived;
but dramatically they are not strong.
Another criticism, which has already been made
by the Danish critic, Georg Brandes, refers to an
offence against this very historical sense which is
usually so vivid in Bj&ouml;rnson. When Frakark, the
Lady Macbeth of the play, remarks, "I am far
from feeling sure of the individual mortality so
much preached of; but there is an immortality of
which I am sure; it is that of the race," she makes
an intellectual somersault from the twelfth century
into the nineteenth, and never gets back
firmly on her pagan feet again. As Brandes wittily
observes: "People who talk like that do not
torture their enemy to death; they backbite him."</p>

<p>The third part opens with Sigurd's appearance
at court, where he reveals his origin and asks for
his share of the kingdom. The king is not disinclined
to grant his request, but is overruled by his
councillors, who profit by his weakness and rule in
his name. They fear this man of many battles,
with the mark of kingship on his brow; and they
determine to murder him. But Sigurd escapes
from prison, and, holding the king responsible for
the treachery, kills him. From this time forth he
is an outlaw, hunted over field and fell, and roaming
with untold sufferings through the mountains
and wildernesses. There he meets a Finnish maiden<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
who loves him, reveals his fate to him, and implores
him to abandon his ambition and dwell
among her people. These scenes amid the eternal
wastes of snow are perhaps the most striking in
the trilogy and most abounding in exquisite
poetic thought. Sigurd hastens hence to his doom
at the battle of Holmengra, where he is defeated,
and, with fiendish atrocity, slowly tortured to
death. The rather lyrical monologue preceding
his death, in which he bids farewell to life and
calmly adjusts his gaze to eternity, is very beautiful,
but, historically, a trifle out of tune. Barring
these occasional lapses from the key, the trilogy
of "Sigurd Slembe" is a noble work.</p>

<p>A respectful, and in part enthusiastic, reception
had been accorded to Bj&ouml;rnson's early plays. But
his first dramatic triumph he celebrated at the
performance of "Mary Stuart in Scotland." Externally
this is the most effective of his plays.
The dialogue is often brilliant, and bristles with
telling points. It is eminently "actable," presenting
striking tableaus and situations. Behind the
author we catch a glimpse of the practical stage-manager
who knows how a scene will look on the
boards and how a speech will sound&mdash;who can surmise
with tolerable accuracy how they will affect a
first-night audience.</p>

<p>"Mary Stuart" is theatrically no less than
dramatically conceived. Theatrically it is far
superior to Swinburne's "Chastelard" (not to
speak of his interminable musical verbiage in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
"Bothwell") but it is paler, colder, and poetically
inferior. The voluptuous warmth and wealth
of color, the exquisite levity, the <i>d&eacute;bonnaire</i> grace
of the Swinburnian drama we seek in vain. Bj&ouml;rnson
is vigorous, but he is not subtile. Mere feline
amorousness, such as Swinburne so inimitably portrays,
he would disdain to deal with if even he could.
Such a bit of intricate self-characterization as the
English poet puts into the Queen's mouth in the
first scene with Chastelard, in the third act, lies utterly
beyond the range of the sturdier Norseman.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>Queen</i>: "Nay, dear, I have<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No tears in me; I never shall weep much,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I think, in all my life: I have wept for wrath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sometimes, and for mere pain, but for love's pity<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I cannot weep at all. I would to God<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You loved me less: I give you all I can<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For all this love of yours, and yet I am sure<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I shall live out the sorrow of your death<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And be glad afterwards. You know I am sorry.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I should weep now; forgive me for your part.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">God made me hard, I think. Alas! you see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I had fain been other than I am."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Add to this the beautifully illuminating threat,
"I shall be deadly to you," uttered in the midst
of amorous cooings and murmurings, and we catch
a glimpse of the demoniac depth of this woman's
nature. Bj&ouml;rnson's "Mary Stuart" weeps more
than once; nay, she says to Bothwell, when he has
forcibly abducted her to his castle:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"This is my first prayer to you,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That I may weep."<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span></div></div>

<p>Quite in the same key is her exclamation (in the
same scene) in response to Bothwell's reference to
her son:</p>

<p>"My son, my lovely boy! Oh, God, now he lies
sleeping in his little white bed, and does not know
how his mother is battling for his sake."</p>

<p>Schiller, whose conception of womankind was as
honestly single and respectful as that of Bj&ouml;rnson,
had set a notable precedent in representing Mary
Stuart as a martyr of a lost cause. The psychological
antitheses of her character, her softness
and loving surrender, and her treachery and cruelty&mdash;he
left out of account.</p>

<p>Without troubling himself greatly about her
guilt, which, though with many palliating circumstances,
he admitted, he undertook to exemplify in
her the beauty and exaltation of noble suffering.
His Mary (which has always been a favorite with
tragic actresses) is in my opinion as devoid of that
insinuating, sense-compelling charm which alone
can account for this extraordinary woman's career
as is the heroine of Bj&ouml;rnson's play. In fact
Bj&ouml;rnson's Mary lies half-way between the amorous
young tigress of Swinburne and the statuesque
martyr of Schiller. She is less intricately feminine
than the former, and more so than the latter.
But she is yet a long way removed from her historical
original, who must have been a strong and
full-blooded character, with just that touch of mystery
which nature always wears to whomsoever
gazes deeply upon her. That subtile intercoiling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
of antagonistic traits, which in a man could never
coexist, is to be found in many historic women of
the Renaissance&mdash;exquisite, dangerous creatures,
half-doves, half-serpents, half-Clytemnestra, half-Venus,
whose full-throbbing passion now made
them soft and tender, over-brimming with loveliness,
now fierce and imperious, their outraged
pride revelling in vengeance and blood. If Bj&ouml;rnson
could have fathomed the depth and complexity
of the historical Mary Stuart to the extent that
Swinburne has done, he would, no doubt, also
have devised a more effective conclusion to his
play. There is no dramatic climax, far less a
tragic one, in the dethronement of Mary, and the
proclamation by John Knox, which is chiefly an
assertion of popular sovereignty, and the triumph
of the Presbyterian Church. The declaration of
the final chorus, that</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Evil shall be routed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And weakness must follow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The might of truth shall pierce<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the last retreat of gloom,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>seems to me rather to muddle than to clarify the
situation. There is a wavering and uncertain sound
in it which seems inappropriate to a triumphant
strain, when the organist naturally turns on the
full force of his organ. If (as is obvious) the
Queen represents the evil, or at least the weakness,
which has been routed, it would appear that she
ought to have been painted in quite different colors.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p>Bj&ouml;rnson's next dramatic venture, which rejoices
to this day in an unabated popularity, was
the two-act comedy, "The Newly Married" (<i>De
Nygifte</i>). Goethe once made the remark that he
was not a good dramatist, because his nature was
too conciliatory. Without intending disparagement,
I am inclined to apply the same judgment
to Bj&ouml;rnson. His sunny optimism shrinks from
irreconcilable conflicts and insoluble problems;
and in his desire to reconcile and solve, he occasionally
is in danger of wrenching his characters
out of drawing and muddling their motives. Half
a dozen critics have already called attention to the
ambiguity of Mathilde's position and intentions in
"The Newly Married." That she loves Axel, the
husband, is clear; and the probability is that she
meant to avenge herself upon him for having before
his marriage used her as a decoy, when the
real object of his attention was her friend Laura.
But if such was her object, she lacked the strength
of mind and hardness of heart to carry it out, and
in the end she becomes a benevolent providence,
who labors for the reconciliation of the estranged
couple. She proves too noble for the ignoble <i>r&ocirc;le</i>
she had undertaken. Instead of wrecking the
marriage, she sacrifices herself upon the altar of
friendship. To that there can, of course, be no
objection; but in that case the process of her
mental change ought to have been clearly shown.
In Ibsen's "Rosmersholm," Rebecca West, occupying
a somewhat similar position, is subject to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
the same ennobling of motive; but the whole
drama hinges upon her moral evolution, and nothing
is left to inference.</p>

<p>The situation in "The Newly Married" is an
extremely delicate one, and required delicate handling.
Axel, a young and gifted lawyer, has married
Laura, the daughter of a high and wealthy
official, who prides himself on his family dignity
and connections. Laura, being an only child, has
been petted and spoiled since her birth, and is but
a grown-up little girl, with no conception of her
matrimonial obligations. She subordinates her
relation to her husband to that to her parents,
and exasperates the former by her bland and obstinate
immaturity. At last, being able to bear it
no longer, he compels her to leave the home of her
parents, where they have hitherto been living, and
establishes himself in a distant town. Mathilde,
Laura's friend, accompanies them, though it is
difficult to conjecture in what capacity; and publishes
an anonymous novel, in which she enlightens
the young wife regarding the probable results of
her conduct. She thrusts a lamp into the dusk of
her soul and frightens her by the things she shows
her. She also, by arousing her jealousy, leads her
out of childhood, with its veiled vision and happy
ignorance, into womanhood, with its unflinching
recognition of the realities that were hidden from
the child. And thus she paves the way for the
reconciliation which takes place in the presence of
the old people, who pay their daughter a visit <i>en route</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
for Italy. Mathilde, having accomplished
her mission, acknowledges the authorship of the
anonymous novel, and is now content to leave
husband and wife in the confidence that they will
work out their own salvation.</p>

<p>A mere skeleton of this simple plot (which
barely hints at the real problem) can, of course,
give no conception of the charm, the color, and
the wonderful poetic afflatus of this exquisite little
play. It may be well enough to say that such a
situation is far-fetched and not very typical&mdash;that
outside of "The Heavenly Twins," <i>et id omne
genus</i>, wives who insist upon remaining maidens
are not very frequent; but, in spite of this drawback,
the vividness and emotional force of the dialogue
and the beautiful characterization (particularly
of the old governor and his wife) set certain
sweet chords in vibration, and carry the play to
a triumphant issue.</p>

<p>As a school-boy I witnessed the first performance
of "The Newly Married," at the Christiania
Theatre (1865), (as, indeed, of all the Bj&ouml;rnsonian
dramas up to 1869); and I yet remember my surprise
when, instead of mail-clad Norse warriors,
carousing in a sooty, log-built hall, the curtain
rose upon a modern interior, in which a fashionably
attired young lady kissed a frock-coated old
gentleman. It was a dire disappointment to me
and my comrade, who had come thirsting for gore.
But how completely the poet conquered us! Each
phrase seemed to woo our reluctant ears, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
pulse of life that beat in the characters and carried
along the action awakened in us a delighted recognition.
Truth to tell, we had but the very vaguest
idea of what was the <i>prima causa malorum</i>; but
for all that, with the rest of the audience, we were
immensely gratified that the upshot of it all was so
satisfactory.</p>

<p>During the years 1865-67 Bj&ouml;rnson occupied the
position of artistic director of the Christiania Theatre,
and edited the illustrated weekly paper, <i>Norsk
Folkeblad</i> ("The Norwegian People's Journal").
As the champion of Norwegian nationality in literature,
and on the stage, he unfolded an amazing
activity. In 1870 he published "Arnljot Gelline,"
a lyrical epic, relating, in a series of poems of irregular
metres, the story of the pagan marauder of that
name, and his conversion to Christianity by King
Olaf the Saint. Never has he found a more daring
and tremendous expression for the spirit of old
Norse paganism than in this powerful but somewhat
chaotic poem. Never has anyone gazed more
deeply into the ferocious heart of the primitive,
predatory man, whose free, wild soul had not yet
been tamed by social obligations and the scourge
of the law. In the same year (1870) was published
the now classical collection of "Poems and Songs"
(<i>Digte og Sange</i>), which, it is no exaggeration to
say, marks a new era in the Norwegian lyric.
Among Bj&ouml;rnson's predecessors there are but two
lyrists of the first order, viz., Wergeland and Welhaven.
The former was magnificently profuse and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
chaotic, abounding in verve and daring imagery,
but withal high-sounding, declamatory, and, at his
worst, bombastic. There is a reminiscence in him
of Klopstock's inflated rhetoric; and a certain
dithyrambic ecstasy&mdash;a strained, high-keyed aria-style
which sometimes breaks into falsetto. His
great rival, Welhaven, was soberer, clearer, more
gravely melodious. He sang in beautiful, tempered
strains, along the middle octaves, never ranging
high into the treble or deep into the base. There
is a certain Tennysonian sweetness, artistic self-restraint,
and plastic simplicity in his lyrics; just
as there is in Wergeland's reformatory ardor, his
noble rage, and his piling up of worlds, &aelig;ons, and
eternities a striking kinship to Shelley. But both
these poets, though their patriotism was strong,
were intellectually Europeans, rather than Norwegians.
The roots of their culture were in the general
soil of the century, whose ideas they had absorbed.
Their personalities were not sufficiently
tinged with the color of nationality to give a distinctly
Norse cadence to their voices. Wergeland
seems to me like a man who was desperately anxious
to acquire a national accent; but somehow
never could catch the trick of it. As regards
Welhaven, he was less aware of his deficiency (if
deficiency it was); but was content to sing of
Norse themes in a key of grave, universal beauty.
Of the new note that came into the Norwegian lyric
with Bj&ouml;rnson, I can discover no hint in his predecessors.
Such a poem as, for instance, "Nils Finn,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
with its inimitably droll refrain&mdash;how utterly inconceivable
it would be in the mouth of Wergeland
or Welhaven! The new quality in it is as unexplainable
as the poem itself is untranslatable. It
has that inexpressible cadence and inflection of
the Norse dialect which you feel (if you have
the conditions for recognizing it) in the first word
a Norseman addresses to you. It has that wonderful
twang of the Hardanger fiddle, and the
color and sentiment of the ballads sung and the
legendary tales recited around the hearth in a Norwegian
homestead during the long winter nights.
With Bj&ouml;rnson it was in the blood. It was his
soul's accent, the dialect of his thought, the cadence
of his emotion. And so, also, is the touching
minor undertone in the poem, the tragic strain in
the half burlesque, which is again so deeply Norwegian.
Who that has ever been present at a
Norse peasant wedding has failed to be struck with
the strangely melancholy strain in the merriest
dances? And in Landstad's collection of "Norwegian
Ballads" there is the same blending of humor
and pathos in such genuine folk-songs as
<i>Truls med bogin, Mindre Alf</i>, and scores of others.
To this day I cannot read "Nils Finn," humorous
though it is, without an almost painful emotion.
All Norway, with a host of precious memories, rises
out of the mist of the past at the very first verse:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Og vetli Nils Finn skuldi ut at g&aring;,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Han fek inki ski 'i tel at hanga p&aring;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;'Dat var ilt' sa'd 'uppundir.'"<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></div></div>

<p>Neither Wergeland nor Welhaven nor any other
poet has with all his rapturous description of fjord,
valley, and mountain, this power to conjure up the
very soul of the Norseland. The purely juvenile
rhymes of Bj&ouml;rnson, such as <i>Killebukken, Lokkeleg</i>
and <i>Haren og Raeven</i> ("The Hare and the
Fox"), are significant because of the masterly security
with which they strike the national key
and keep it. Not a word is there that rings false.
And with what an exquisite tenderness the elegaic
ballad strain is rendered in <i>Venevil</i> and "Hidden
Love" (<i>Dulgt Kaerlighed</i>), and the playful in the
deliciously girlish roguery of <i>Vidste du bare</i> ("If
you only knew"), and the bold dash and young
wantonness of "Marit's Song!"</p>

<p>It seems to me that every Norseman's life,
whether he is willing to acknowledge it or not, has
been made richer and more beautiful by this precious
volume. It contains a legacy to the Norwegian
people which can never grow old. If Bj&ouml;rnson
had written nothing else, he would still be the
first poet of Norway. How brazen, hollow, and
bombastic sound the patriotic lyrics of Bjerregaard
Johan Storm Munch, S. O. Wolff, etc., which are
yet sung at festal gatherings, by the side of Bj&ouml;rnson's
"Yes, we Love our Native Country," and
"I will Guard Thee, my Land!" There is the
brassy blare of challenging trumpets in the former;
they defy all creation, and make a vast deal
of impotent and unprofitable noise about "The
roaring northern main," "The ancient Norway's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
rocky fastness," "Liberty's temple in Norroway's
valleys," and "Norway's lion, whose axe doth
threaten him who dares break the Northland's
peace."</p>

<p>Not a suggestion of this juvenile braggadocio is
there to be found in Bj&ouml;rnson. Calm, strong, and
nobly aglow with love of country, he has no need
of going into paroxysms in order to prove his sincerity.
To those who regard the declamatory note
as indispensable to a national hymn (as we have it,
for instance, in "Hail, Columbia," and "The Star-spangled
Banner") the low key in which Bj&ouml;rnson's
songs are pitched will no doubt appear as a
blemish. But it is their very homeliness in connection
with the deep, full-throbbing emotion
which beats in each forceful phrase&mdash;it is this, I
fancy, which has made them the common property
of the whole people, and thus in the truest sense
national. I could never tell why my heart gives a
leap at the sound of the simple verse:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Yes, we love this land of ours,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rising from the foam,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rugged, furrowed, weather-beaten,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With its thousand homes."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Kjerulf's glorious music is, no doubt, in a measure
accountable for it; but even apart from that,
there is a strangely moving power in the words.
The poem, as such, is by no means faultless. It
is easy to pick flaws in it. The transition from
the fifth and sixth lines of the first verse: "Love
it, love it, and think of our father and mother," to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
the seventh and eighth, "And the saga night which
makes dreams to descend upon our earth," is unwarrantably
forced and abrupt. And yet who
would wish it changed? It may be admitted that
there is no very subtle art in the rude rhyme:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"I will guard thee, my land,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I will build thee, my land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I will cherish my land in my prayer, in my child!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I will foster its weal,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And its wants I will heal<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the boundary out to the ocean wild;"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>but, for all that, it touches a chord in every Norseman's
breast, which never fails to vibrate responsively.</p>

<p>As regards Bj&ouml;rnson's prosody, I am aware that
it is sometimes defective. Measured by the Tennysonian
standard it is often needlessly rugged
and eccentric. But a poet whose bark carries so
heavy a cargo of thought may be forgiven if occasionally
it scrapes the bottom. Moreover, the
Norwegian tongue has never, as a medium of poetry,
been polished and refined to any such elaborate
perfection as the English language exhibits in
the hands of Swinburne and Tennyson.</p>

<p>The saga-drama, "Sigurd the Crusader," which
was also published in 1870, is a work of minor consequence.
Its purpose may be stated in the author's
own words:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"'Sigurd the Crusader' is meant to be what is called a
'folk-play.' It is my intention to make several dramatic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
experiments with grand scenes from the sagas, lifting them
into a strong but not too heavy frame. By a 'folk-play' I
mean a play which should appeal to every eye and every
stage of culture, to each in its own way, and at the performance
of which all, for the time being, would experience the
joy of fellow-feeling. The common history of a people is
best available for this purpose&mdash;nay, it ought dramatically
never to be treated otherwise. The treatment must necessarily
be simple and the emotions predominant; it should be
accompanied with music, and the development should progress
in clear groups....</p>

<p>"The old as well as the new historic folk literature will,
with its corresponding comic element, as I think, be a great
gain to the stage, and will preserve its connection with the
people where this has not already been lost&mdash;so that it be no
longer a mere institution for amusement, and that only to a
single class. Unless we take this view of our stage, it will
lose its right to be regarded as a national affair, and the best
part of its purpose, to unite while it lifts and makes us free,
will be gradually assumed by some other agency. Nor shall
we ever get actors fit for anything but trifles, unless we abandon
our foreign French tendency as a <i>leading</i> one and substitute
the national needs of our own people in its place."</p></div>

<p>It would be interesting to note how the poet has
attempted to solve a problem so important and so
difficult as this. In the first place, we find in
"Sigurd the Crusader" not a trace of a didactic
purpose beyond that of familiarizing the people
with its own history, and this, as he himself admits
in the preface just quoted, is merely a secondary
consideration. He wishes to make all, irrespective
of age, culture, and social station, feel
strongly the bond of their common nationality;
and, with this in view, he proceeds to unroll to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
them a panorama of simple but striking situations,
knit together by a plot or story which, without the
faintest tinge of sensationalism, appeals to those
broadly human and national sympathies which
form the common mental basis of Norse ignorance
and Norse culture. He seizes the point in the
saga where the long-smouldering hostility between
the royal brothers, Sigurd the Crusader and Eystein,
has broken into full blaze, and traces, in a
series of vigorously sketched scenes, the intrigue
and counter-intrigue which hurry the action
onward toward its logically prepared climax&mdash;a
mutual reconciliation. The dialogue is pithy,
simple, and sententious. Nevertheless the play, as
a whole, makes the impression of incompleteness.
It is a dramatic sketch rather than a drama. It
marks no advance on Bj&ouml;rnson's previous work in
the same line; but perhaps rather a retrogression.</p>


<h3>II</h3>

<p>A period is apt to come in the life of every man
who is spiritually alive, when his scholastic culture
begins to appear insufficient and the traditional
premises of existence seem in need of readjustment
and revision. This period, with the spiritual
crisis which it involves, is likely to occur
between the thirtieth and the fortieth meridian.
Ibsen was thirty-four years old (1862) when in
"The Comedy of Love" he broke with the romanticism<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
of his youth, and began to wrestle with the
problems of contemporary life. Goethe was thirty-seven
when, in 1786, he turned his back upon the
Storm and Stress, and in Italy sought and gained
a new and saner vision of the world. This renewal
of the sources which water the roots of his
spiritual being becomes an imperative necessity to
a man when he has exhausted the sources which
tradition supplies. It is terrible to wake up one
morning and see one's past life in a new and
strange illumination, and the dust of ages lying
inch-thick upon one's thoughts. It is distressing
to have to pretend that you do not hear the doubt
which whispers early and late in your ear, <i>Vanitas,
vanitas, vanitas vanitatum</i>. Few are those
of us who have the courage to face it, to rise up
and fight with it, and rout it or be routed by it.</p>

<p>Bj&ouml;rnson had up to this time (1870) built solely
upon tradition. He had been orthodox, and had
exalted childlike peace and faith above doubt and
struggle. Phrases indicative of a certain spiritual
immaturity are scattered through his early poems.
In "The Child in our Soul," he says, for instance:
"The greatest man on earth must cherish the child
in his soul and listen, amid the thunder, to what
it whispers low;" and again: "Everything great
that thought has invented sprouted forth in childlike
joy; and everything strong, sprung from what
is good, obeyed the child's voice." Though in a
certain sense that may be true enough, it belongs
to the kind of half-truths which by constant repetition<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
grow pernicious and false. The man who at
forty assumes the child's attitude of mere wondering
acceptance toward the world and its problems,
may, indeed, be a very estimable character; but
he will never amount to much. It is the honest
doubters, the importunate questioners, the indefatigable
fighters who have broken humanity's
shackles, and made the world a more comfortable
abiding-place to the present generation than it was
to the past. There is unquestionably a strain of
Danish romanticism in Bj&ouml;rnson's persistent harping
upon childlike faith and simplicity and a
childlike vision of the world. Grundtvig, with
whom this note is pervasive, had in his early youth
a great influence over him. The glorification of
primitive feeling was part of the romantic revolt
against the dry rationalism of the so-called period
of enlightenment.</p>

<p>To account for the fact that so mighty a spirit
as Bj&ouml;rnson could have reached his thirty-eighth
year before emerging from this state of idyllic
<i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i>, I am inclined to quote the following passage
from Brandes, descriptive of the condition of
the Scandinavian countries during the decade preceding
1870:</p>

<p>"While the intellectual life languished, as a
plant droops in a close, confined place, the people
were self-satisfied&mdash;though not with a joyous or
noisy self-satisfaction; for there was much sadness
in their minds after the great disasters [the Sleswick-Holstein
War].... They rested on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
their laurels and fell into a doze. And while they
dozed they had dreams. The cultivated, and especially
the half-cultivated, public in Denmark
and Norway dreamed that they were the salt of
Europe. They dreamed that by their idealism&mdash;the
ideals of Grundtvig and Kierkegaard&mdash;and
their strong vigilance, they regenerated the foreign
nations. They dreamed that they were the power
which could rule the world, but which, for mysterious
and incomprehensible reasons, had for a
long series of years preferred to eat crumbs from
the foreigners' table. They dreamed that they
were the free, mighty North, which led the cause
of the peoples to victory&mdash;and they woke up unfree,
impotent, ignorant."<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> Brandes: Det Moderne Gjennembrud's Maend, pp. 44, 45.</p></div>

<p>Though there is a good deal of malice, there is
no exaggeration in this unflattering statement.
Scandinavia had by its own choice cut itself off
from the cosmopolitan world life; and the great
ideas which agitated Europe found scarcely an
echo in the three kingdoms. In my own boyhood,
which coincides with Bj&ouml;rnson's early manhood, I
heard on all hands expressions of self-congratulation
because the doubt and fermenting restlessness
which were undermining the great societies abroad
had never ruffled the placid surface of our good,
old-fashioned, Scandinavian orthodoxy. How
heartily we laughed at the absurdities of Darwin,
who, as we had read in the newspapers, believed
that he was descended from an ape! How deeply,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
densely, and solidly ignorant we were; and yet
how superior we felt in the midst of our ignorance!</p>

<p>All this must be taken into account, if we are to
measure the significance, as well as the courage, of
Bj&ouml;rnson's apostasy. For five years (1870-74)
he published nothing of an &aelig;sthetical character.
But he plunged with hot zeal into political life,
not only because he needed an outlet for his pent-up
energy; but because the question at issue engaged
him, heart and soul. The equal and co-ordinate
position of Norway and Sweden under the
union had been guaranteed by the Constitution of
1814; but, as a matter of fact, the former kingdom
is by all the world looked upon as a dependency,
if not a province, of the latter. The Bernadottes,
lacking comprehension of the Norwegian
character, had shown themselves purblind as bats
in their dealings with Norway. They had mistaken
a perfectly legitimate desire for self-government
for a demonstration of hostility to Sweden
and the royal house; and instead of identifying
themselves with the national movement (which
they might well have done), they fought it, first
by cautious measures of repression, and later by
vetoes and open defiance. Charles XV., and,
later, Oscar II., kept the minority ministries,
Stang and Selmer, in power, with a bland disregard
of popular condemnation, and snapped their
fingers at the parliamentary majorities which, for
well-nigh a quarter of a century, fought persistently,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
bravely, and not altogether vainly, for their
country's rights.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that Norway is the most democratic
country in Europe, if not in the world.
There is a far sturdier sense of personal worth, a
far more fearless assertion of equality, and a far
more democratic feeling permeating society than,
for instance, in the United States. Sweden, on the
other hand, is essentially an aristocratic country,
with a landed nobility and many other remnants
of feudalism in her political and social institutions.
Two countries so different in character can never
be good yoke-fellows. They can never develop at
an even pace, and the fact of kinship scarcely
helps matters where the temperaments and the
conditions are so widely dissimilar. Brothers who
fall out are apt to fight each other the more fiercely
on account of the relationship. Bj&ouml;rnson certainly
does not cherish any hatred of Sweden, nor do I
believe that there is any general animosity to the
Swedish people to be found anywhere in Norway.
It is most unfortunate that the mistaken policy of
the Bernadottes has placed the two nations in an
attitude of apparent hostility. In spite of the
loud denunciation of Norway by the so-called
Grand Swedish party, and the equally vociferous
response of the Norwegian journals (of the Left)
there is a strong sympathy between the democracy
of Norway and that of Sweden, and a mutual respect
which no misrepresentation can destroy.</p>

<p>It was Bj&ouml;rnson who, in 1873, began the agitation<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
for the actual and not merely nominal, equality of
the two kingdoms;<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> he appealed to the national
sense of honor, and by his kindling eloquence
aroused the tremendous popular indignation that
swept the old ministry of Stang from power, and
caused the impeachment and condemnation of the
Selmer ministry. It would seem when the king,
in 1882, charged the liberal leader, Mr. Johan
Sverdrup, to form a ministry, that parliamentarism
had actually triumphed. But unhappily a new
Stang ministry (the chief of which is the son of
the old premier) has, recently (1893) re-established
the odious minority rule, which sits like a nightmare
upon the nation's breast, checking its respiration,
and hindering its natural development.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> I had the pleasure of accompanying Bj&ouml;rnson on his first political
tour in the summer of 1873, and I shall never forget the tremendous
impression of the man and his mighty eloquence at the
great folk-meeting at B&ouml;e in Guldbrandsdalen.</p></div>

<p>During this period of national self-assertion
Bj&ouml;rnson has unfolded a colossal activity. Though
holding no office, and steadily refusing an election
to the Storthing, he has been the life and soul of
the liberal party. The task which he had undertaken
grew upon his hands, and assumed wider and
wider dimensions. As his predecessor Wergeland
had done, and in a far deeper sense, he consecrated
his life to the spiritual and intellectual liberation
of his people. It is told of the former that he was
in the habit of walking about the country with his
pockets full of seeds of grass and trees, of which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
he scattered a handful here and a handful there;
for, he said, you can never tell what will grow up
after it. There is to me something quite touching
in the patriotism which prompted this act. Bj&ouml;rnson,
too, is in the same sense "a sower who went
forth for to sow." And the golden grain of his
thought falls, as in the parable, in all sorts of
places; but, unlike some of the seed in the parable,
it all leaves some trace behind. It stimulates reflection,
it awakens life, it arouses the torpid soul, it
shakes the drowsy soul, it shocks the pious soul, it
frightens the timid soul, but it lifts them all, as it
were, by main force, out of themselves, and makes
healthful breezes blow, and refreshing showers fall
upon what was formerly a barren waste. This is
Bj&ouml;rnson's mission; this is, during the second period
of his career, his greatness and his highest significance.</p>

<p>Of course there are many opinions as to the value
of the work he has accomplished in this capacity
of political and religious liberator. The Conservative
party of Norway, which runs the errands of
the king and truckles to Sweden, hates him with a
bitter and furious hatred; the clergy denounce him,
and the official bureaucracy can scarcely mention
his name without an anathema. But the common
people, though he has frightened many of them
away by his heterodoxy, still love him. It is especially
his disrespect to the devil (whom he professes
not to believe in) which has been a sore trial
to the Bible-reading, hymn-singing peasantry.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
Does not the Bible say that the devil goes about
like a roaring lion seeking whom he may devour?
Nevertheless Bj&ouml;rnson has the hardihood to assert
that there is no such person. And yet Bj&ouml;rnson
is a man who can talk most beautifully, and who
knows as much as any parson. It is extremely
puzzling.</p>

<p>The fact was, Bj&ouml;rnson's abolition of the devil,
and his declaration of a war against the orthodox
miracle faith, were, as far as the Norwegian people
were concerned, somewhat premature. The
peasant needs the old scriptural devil, and is not
yet ready to dispense with him. The devil is a
popular character in the folk-stories and legends,
and I have known some excellent people who declare
that they have seen him. Creeds are like
certain ancient tumuli, which now are but graves,
but were once the habitations of living men.
The dust, ashes, and bones of defunct life which
they often contain, nourish in the dark the green
grass, the fair flowers, the blooming trees, that
shoot up into the light. You cannot dig it all
up and throw it out without tearing asunder the
net-work of roots which organically connects the
living with the dead.</p>

<p>Bj&ouml;rnson, though he is an evolutionist, is far
removed from the philosophic temper in his dealings
with the obsolete or obsolescent remnants in
political and religious creeds. He has the healthful
intolerance of strong conviction. He is too
good a partisan to admit that there may be another<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
side to the question which might be worth considering.
With magnificent ruthlessness he plunges
ahead, and with a truly old Norse pugnacity he
stands in the thick of the fight, rejoicing in battle.
Only combat arouses his Titanic energy and calls
all his splendid faculties into play.</p>

<p>Even apart from his political propaganda the
years 1870-74 were a period of labor and ferment
to Bj&ouml;rnson. The mightier the man, the mightier
the powers enlisted in his conversion, and the
mightier the struggle. A tremendous wrench was
required to change his point of view from that of
a childlike, wondering believer to that of a critical
sceptic and thinker. In a certain sense Bj&ouml;rnson
never took this step; for when the struggle was
over, and he had readjusted his vision of life to the
theory of evolution, he became as ardent an adherent
of it as he had ever been of the <i>na&iuml;ve</i> Grundtvigian
miracle-faith. And with the deep need of
his nature to pour itself forth&mdash;to share its treasures
with all the world&mdash;he started out to proclaim
his discoveries. Besides Darwin and Spencer, he
had made a study of Stuart Mill, whose noble sense
of fair-play had impressed him. He plunged with
hot zeal into the writings of Steinthal and Max M&uuml;ller,
whose studies in comparative religion changed
to him the whole aspect of the universe. Taine's
historical criticism, with its disrespectful derivation
of the hero from food, climate, and race, lured him
still farther away from his old Norse and romantic
landmarks, until there was no longer any hope of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
his ever returning to them. But when from this
promontory of advanced thought he looked back
upon his idyllic love-stories of peasant lads and
lasses, and his taciturn saga heroes, with their
predatory self-assertion, he saw that he had done
with them forever; that they could never more
enlist his former interest. On the other hand, the
problems of modern contemporary life, of which
he had now gained quite a new comprehension,
tempted him. The romantic productions of his
youth appeared as a more or less arbitrary play
of fancy emancipated from the stern logic of
reality. It was his purpose henceforth to consecrate
his powers to the study of the deeper soul-life
of his own age and the exposition of the forces
which in their interdependence and interaction
make modern society.</p>

<p>This is the significance of the four-act drama
"Bankruptcy," with which, in 1874, he astounded
and disappointed the Scandinavian public. I have
called it a drama, in accordance with the author's
designation on the title-page; but it is, in the best
sense, a comedy of manners, of the kind that Augier
produced in France; and in everything except
the mechanics of construction superior to the
plays of Sardou and Dumas. The dialogue has the
most admirable accent of truth. It is not unnaturally
witty or brilliant; but exhibits exactly the
traits which Norwegians of the higher commercial
plutocracy are likely to exhibit. All the poetic
touches which charmed us in Bj&ouml;rnson's saga<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>
dramas were conspicuous by their absence. Scarcely
a trace was there left of that peculiar and delightful
language of his early novels, which can
only be described by the term "Bj&ouml;rnsonian."</p>

<p>"Dry, prosaic, trivial," said the reviewers;
"Bj&ouml;rnson has evidently worked out his vein.
He has ceased to be a poet. He has lost with his
childhood's faith his ideal view of life, and become
a mere prosy chronicler of uninteresting everyday
events."</p>

<p>This was, indeed, the general verdict of the public
twenty years ago. Scarcely anyone had a good
word to say for the abused play that marked the
poet's fall from the idealism of his early song. But,
for all that, "Bankruptcy" made a strong impression
upon the boards. It not only conquered a
permanent place in the <i>r&eacute;pertoires</i> of the theatres
of the Scandinavian capitals, but it spread through
Austria, Germany, and Holland, and has finally
scored a success at the <i>Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Libre</i> in Paris.
There is scarcely a theatre of any consequence in
Germany which has not made "Bankruptcy" part
of its <i>r&eacute;pertoire</i>. At the Royal Theatre in Munich
it was accorded a most triumphant reception, and
something over sixty representations has not yet
exhausted its popularity.</p>

<p>The effort to come to close quarters with reality
is visible in every phrase. The denial of the value
of all the old romantic stage machinery, with its
artificial climaxes and explosive effects, is perceptible
in the quiet endings of the acts and the entirely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
unsensational exposition of the dramatic action.
There is one scene (and by no means an
unnatural one) in which there is a touch of violence,
viz., where Tjaelde, while he hopes to avert
his bankruptcy, threatens to shoot Lawyer Berent
and himself; but there is a very human quiver in
the threat and in the passionate outbreak which
precedes it. Nowhere is there a breath of that
superheated hot-house atmosphere which usually
pervades the modern drama.</p>

<p>"Bankruptcy" deals, as the title indicates, with
the question of financial honesty. Zola has in <i>Le
Roman Sentimental</i> made the observation that
"absolute honesty no more exists than perfect
healthfulness. There is a tinge of the human
beast in us all, as there is a tinge of illness."
Tjaelde, the great merchant, exemplifies this proposition.
He is a fairly honest man, who by the
modern commercial methods, which, in self-defence,
he has been forced to adopt, gets into the
position of a rogue. The commandment, "Thou
shalt not steal," seems at first glance an extremely
simple injunction; but in the light of Bj&ouml;rnson's
searching analysis it becomes a complex and intricate
tangle, capable of interesting shades and <i>nuances</i>
of meaning. Tjaelde, in the author's opinion,
certainly does steal, when, in order to save himself
(and thereby the thousands who are involved
in his affairs), he speculates with other people's
money and presents a rose-colored account of his
business, when he knows that he is on the verge of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
bankruptcy. But, on the other hand, it is extremely
difficult to determine the point where legitimate
speculation ceases and the illegitimate begins.
And if Tjaelde neglected any legitimate means of
saving his estate he would be culpable. A stern
code of morals (which the commercial world of to-day
would scarcely exact), the poet enforces in the
fourth act, where Tjaelde refuses to accept any concession
from his creditors, but insists upon devoting
the remainder of his life to the liquidation of
his debts.</p>

<p>Admirably strong and vital is the exposition of
the <i>r&ocirc;le</i> and functions of money in the modern
world, and the nearer and remoter psychological
effects of the tremendous tyranny of money. A
certain external <i>&eacute;clat</i> is required to give the great
commercial house the proper splendor in the sight
of the world. Thus Tjaelde speculates in hospitality
as in everything else, and when he virtually
has nothing, makes the grandest splurge in
order to give a spurious impression of prosperity.
Though by nature an affectionate man, he neglects
his family because business demands all his time.
He defrauds himself of the happiness which
knocks at his door, because business fills his head
by night and by day, and absorbs all his energy.
A number of parasites (such as the fortune-hunting
lieutenant) attach themselves to him, as long
as he is reputed to be rich, and make haste to vanish
when his riches take wings. On the other
hand, the true friends whom in his prosperity he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
hectored and contemned are revealed by adversity.
There would be nothing remarkable in so common
an experience, if the friends themselves, as well as
the parasites, were not so delightfully delineated.
The lieutenant, with his almost farcical interest in
the bay trotter, is amusingly but lightly drawn;
but the awkward young clerk, Sannaes, who refuses
to abandon his master in the hour of trial, is a
deeply typical Norwegian figure. All the little
coast towns have specimens to show of these aspiring,
faithful, sensitively organized souls, who, having
had no social advantages are painfully conscious
of their deficiencies, but whose patient
industry and sterling worth in the end will triumph.
No less keenly observed and effectively
sketched is the whole gallery of dastardly little
village figures&mdash;Holm, Falbe, Knutson with an s,
Knutzon, with a z, etc. Signe and Valborg, the
two daughters of Tjaelde, have, in spite of their
diversity, a common tinge of Norwegian nationality
which gives a gentle distinctness and relief to
the world-old types.</p>

<p>Bj&ouml;rnson's next play,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> "The Editor," grapples
with an equally modern and timely subject, viz.,
the license of the press. With terrible vividness he
shows the misery, ruin, and degradation which result
from the present journalistic practice of misrepresentation,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
sophistry, and defamation. It is a
very dark picture he draws, with scarcely a gleam
of light. The satire is savage; and the quiver of
wrath is perceptible in many a sledge-hammer
phrase. You feel that Bj&ouml;rnson himself has suffered
from the terrorism which he here describes, and you
would surmise too, even if you did not know it,
that the editor whom he has here pilloried is no
mere general editorial type, but a well-known person
who, until recently, conducted one of the most
influential journals in Norway. The play is an
act of retribution, and a deserved one. But its
weaknesses, which it is vain to disguise, are also explained
by the author's personal bias&mdash;the desire
to wreak vengeance upon an enemy.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_7_7" id="Footnote_7_7"></a><a href="#FNanchor_7_7"><span class="label">[7]</span></a> All the literary histories and other authorities which I have
consulted put the publication of "Bankruptcy," as well as that of
"The Editor," in 1875. But my own copy of the latter play bears
on its title-page the year 1874.</p></div>

<p>The situation is as follows: Mr. Evje, a rich
and generally respected distiller, has a daughter,
Gertrude, who is engaged to Harold Rein, a political
leader of peasant origin. Mr. Rein's brother,
Halfdan, from whom he has, in a measure, inherited
the leadership, is dying from the persecution
to which he has been exposed by the Conservative
press and public. In his zeal for the
Radical cause it is his consolation that he leaves
it in such strong hands as those of his brother.
The election is impending and a meeting of the
electors has been called for the following day.
Harold is the candidate of the Left. It now becomes
a question with the party of the Right so
to ridicule and defame him as to ruin his chances.
His position as prospective son-in-law of the rich<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
Mr. Evje lends an air of importance and respectability
to his candidacy. Mr. Evje must therefore
be induced, or, if necessary, compelled, to throw
him overboard. With this end in view the editor
of the Conservative journal goes to Evje (whose
schoolmate and friend he has been) and tries to
persuade him to break the alliance with Rein.
Evje, who prides himself on his "moderation"
and tolerance, and his purpose to keep aloof from
partisanship, refuses to be bullied; whereupon
the editor threatens him with social ostracism and
commercial ruin. The distiller, who is at heart
a coward, is completely unnerved by this threat.
Well knowing how a paper can undermine a man's
reputation without making itself liable for libel,
he sends his friend the doctor to the editor, suing
for peace. Late in the evening he meets his foe
outside of his house, and after much shuffling and
parleying agrees to do his will. He surprises his
daughter and Harold Rein in a loving <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>,
and lacks the courage to carry out his bargain.
He vainly endeavors to persuade them to break the
engagement and separate until after the election.</p>

<p>In the meanwhile, John, a discharged servant
of Evje (of whose drunkenness and political radicalism
we have previously been informed), has overheard
the parley with the editor, and in order to
get even with his master countermands in the editor's
name his order to the foreman of the printing-office;
and the obnoxious article which was intended
to be omitted appears in the paper. John<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
also takes care to procure Evje an early copy,
which, first utterly crushes him, then arouses his
wrath, convinces him that "holding aloof" is
mere cowardice, and makes him resolve to bear his
share in the great political battle. The meanness,
the malice of each ingenious thrust, while it stings
and burns also awakens a righteous indignation.
He goes straight to the lodgings of Harold Rein
and determines to attend the Radical meeting. Not
finding him at home he goes to the house of his
brother Halfdan, where he leaves the copy of the
paper. The sick man picks it up, reads an onslaught
on himself which in baseness surpasses the
attack on Evje, starts up in uncontrollable excitement,
and dies of a hemorrhage. The maid, who
sees him lying on the floor, cries out into the street
for help, and the editor, who chances to pass by,
enters. He finds the Radical leader dead, with the
paper clutched in his hand.</p>

<p>The fourth act opens with a festal arrangement
at Evje's in honor of the great success of Rein's
electoral meeting. There is no more "holding
aloof." Everybody has convictions and is ready to
avow the party that upholds them. All are ignorant
of Halfdan Rein's death, until the editor arrives,
utterly broken in spirit and asks Evje's
pardon. He wishes to explain, but no one wishes
to listen. When Evje wavers and is on the point
of accepting his proffered hand, his wife and
daughter loudly protest.</p>

<p>The editor declares his purpose to renounce<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
journalism. The festivities are abandoned, and
all betake themselves to the house of the dead
leader. Thus the play ends; there is no tableau,
no climax, no dramatic catastrophe. It is Zola's
theory<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and Maeterlink's practice anticipated.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_8_8" id="Footnote_8_8"></a><a href="#FNanchor_8_8"><span class="label">[8]</span></a> "Naturalism on the Stage."</p></div>

<p>The journalistic conditions here described are,
of course, those of the Norwegian capital nearly a
quarter of a century ago. Few editors, I fancy, outside
of country towns, now go about personally
spreading rumors, with malice aforethought, and
collecting gossip. But the power of the press for
good and for ill, and the terrorism which, in evil
hands, it exercises, are surely not exaggerated.
But its most striking application has the drama in
its exposure of the desperate and ignominious expedients
to which a party will resort in order to
defeat, defame, and utterly destroy a political opponent.
The following passages may be worth
quoting:</p>

<p>"Most of the successful politicians nowadays
win not by their own greatness but by the paltriness
of the rest."</p>

<p>"Here is a fine specimen of a fossil. It is a
piece of a palm-leaf, ... which was found in a
stratum of Siberian rock.... Thus one must
become in order to endure the ice-storms. Then
one is not harmed. But your brother! In him
lived yet the whole murmuring, singing palm-forest....
As regards you, it remains to be
seen whether you can get all humanity in you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
completely killed.... But who would at that
price be a politician?... That one must
be hardened is the watchword of all nowadays.
Not only army officers but physicians, merchants,
officials are to be hardened or dried up; ...
hardened for the battle of life, as they say. But
what does that mean? We are to expel and
evaporate the warmth of the heart, the fancy's
yearning, ... before we are fit for life....
No, I say, it is those very things we are
to preserve. That's what we have got them for."</p>

<p>Bj&ouml;rnson's increasing Radicalism and his outspoken
Socialistic sympathies had by this time
alienated a large portion of the Scandinavian public.
The cry was heard on all sides that he had
ceased to be a poet, and had become instead a mere
political agitator. I cannot deny myself the pleasure
of quoting Bj&ouml;rnson's reply when at his request
a friend repeated to him the opinion which was
entertained of him in certain quarters:</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," he cried, with a wrathful laugh,
"don't I know it? You must be a poet! You
must not mingle in the world's harsh and jarring
tumult. They have a notion that a poet is a longhaired
man who sits on the top of a tower and
plays upon a harp while his hair streams in the
wind. Yes, a fine kind of poet is that! No, my
boy, I am a poet, not primarily because I can write
verse (there are lots of people who can do that)
but by virtue of seeing more clearly, and feeling
more deeply, and speaking more truly than the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
majority of men. All that concerns humanity
concerns me. If by my song or my speech I can
contribute ever so little toward the amelioration of
the lot of the millions of my poorer fellow-creatures,
I shall be prouder of that than of the combined
laurels of Shakespeare, Milton, and Goethe."</p>

<p>This is the conception of a poet which was prevalent
in Norway in the olden time. The scalds of
the sagas were warriors as well as singers. They
fought with sword and battle-axe, and their song
rang the more boldly because they knew how to
strike up another tune&mdash;the fierce song of the
sword. In modern times Wergeland and Welhaven
have demonstrated not only the pugnacity, but also
the noble courage of their ancestry by espousing
the cause of opposing parties during the struggle
for national independence.</p>

<p>Those who demand that literature shall be untinged
by any tendency or strong conviction will
do well to eschew all the subsequent works of
Bj&ouml;rnson. They might perhaps put up with the
brief novel "Magnhild," which is tolerably neutral
in tone, though it is the least enjoyable of all
Bj&ouml;rnson's works. It gives the impression that
the author is half afraid of his subject (which is
an illicit love), and only dares to handle it so gingerly
as to leave half the tale untold. The short,
abrupt sentences which seemed natural enough
when he was dealing with the peasants, with their
laconic speech and blunt manners, have a forced
and unnatural air when applied to people to whom<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
this style of language is foreign. Moreover, these
condensed sentences are often vague, full of innuendo,
and mysterious as hieroglyphics. It is as if
the author, in the consciousness of the delicacy of
his theme, had lost the bold security of touch
which in his earlier works made his meaning unmistakable.</p>

<p>The drama "The King" (1877) is an attack
upon the monarchical principle in its political as
well as its personal aspect. It is shown how destructive
the royal prerogative is and must be to
the king as an individual; how the artificial regard
which hedges him in, interposing countless barriers
between the truth and him, makes his relations
to his surroundings false and deprives him of
the opportunity for self-knowledge which normal
relations supply. Royalty is therefore a curse, because
it robs its possessor of the wholesome discipline
of life which is the right of every man that is
born into the world.</p>

<p>Furthermore, there is an obvious intention to
show that the monarchy, being founded upon a lie,
is incapable of any real adaptation to the age, and
reconciliation with modern progress. The king in
the play is a young, talented, liberal-minded man,
who is fully conscious of the anomaly of his position,
and determined to save his throne by stripping
it of all medi&aelig;val and mythological garniture. He
dreams of being a "folk-king," the first citizen of
a free people, a kind of hereditary president, with
no sham divinity to fall back upon, and no "grace<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
of God" to shield him from criticism and sanctify
his blunders. He resents the <i>r&ocirc;le</i> of being the lock
of the merchant's strong-box and the head of that
mutual insurance company which is called the
state. He goes about <i>incognito</i>, first in search of
love adventures, and later in order to acquaint
himself with public opinion; and he proves himself
remarkably unprejudiced and capable of profiting
by experience. He falls in love with Clara Ernst,
the daughter of a Radical professor, who, on account
of a book he has written, has been sentenced for
<i>crimen l&aelig;s&aelig; majestatis</i>, and in an attempt to escape
from prison has broken both his legs. Clara,
who is supporting her father in his exile by teaching,
repels the king's advances with indignation
and contempt. He perseveres, however, fascinated
by the novelty of such treatment. He manages
to convince her of the purity of his motives;
and finally succeeds in winning her love. It is not
a <i>liaison</i> he contemplates, but a valid and legitimate
marriage for which he means to compel recognition.
The court, which he has no more use for, he desires
to abolish as a costly and degrading luxury; and in
its place to establish a home&mdash;a model <i>bourgeois</i>
home&mdash;where affection and virtue shall flourish.
Clara, seeing the vast significance of such a step, is
aglow with enthusiasm for its realization. It is
not vanity, but a lofty faith in her mission to regenerate
royalty, by discarding its senseless pomp
and bringing it into accord with, and down to the
level of, common citizenship&mdash;it is this, I say,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
which upholds her in the midst of opprobrium, insults,
and hostile demonstrations. For the king's
subjects, so far from being charmed by his resolution
to marry a woman out of their midst, are
scandalized. They riot, sing mocking songs, circulate
base slanders, and threaten to mob the royal
bride on her way to her first public function. She
is herself terribly wrought up, particularly by the
curse of her father, who hates the king with the
deep hatred of a fanatical Republican. A royal
princess, who had come to insult her, is conquered
by her candor and truth, and stays to sympathize
with her and lend her the support of her presence.
But just as the king comes to lead her out to face
the populace, the wraith of her father rises upon
the threshold and she falls back dead. It is learned
afterward that Professor Ernst had died in that
very hour.</p>

<p>The king's bosom friend, the Minister of the Interior,
Gran, who is largely responsible for his
liberalism, and whose whole policy it has been to
rejuvenate and revitalize the monarchy, is challenged
and shot by his old teacher, the Republican
Flink; and the king himself, convinced of the futility
of all his efforts to realize his idea of a democratic
monarchy, commits suicide.</p>

<p>As a piece of sanguinary satire on royalty as an
institution "The King" is most interesting&mdash;that
is, royalty logically and speculatively considered,
without reference to its historical basis and development.
To me the postulate that it had its origin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
in a kind of conspiracy (for mutual benefit) of the
priest and the king seems shallow and unphilosophical.
Bj&ouml;rnson's fanatical partisanship has
evidently carried him a little too far. For surely
he would himself admit that every free nation
is governed about as well as it deserves to be&mdash;that
its political institutions are a reflection of its
maturity and capacity for self-government. A
certain allowance must, indeed, be made for the
<i>vis inerti&aelig;</i> of whatever exists, which makes it
exert a stubborn and not unwholesome resistance
to the reformer's zeal. This conservatism (which
may, however, have more laudable motives than
mere self-interest) Bj&ouml;rnson has happily satirized
in the scene before the Noblemen's Club in the
third act. But, I fancy, it looks to him only as a
sinister power, which for its own base purposes has
smitten humanity with blindness to its own welfare.
Though not intending to enter into a discussion,
I am also tempted to put a respectful little
interrogation mark after the statement that the
republic is so very much cheaper than the monarchy.
If the experience of the two largest republics
in the world counts for anything, I should say
that in point of economy there was not much to
choose.</p>

<p>Strange as it may seem, Bj&ouml;rnson did not intend
"The King" as an argument in favor of the
republic. In his preface to the third edition he
distinctly repudiates the idea. The recent development
of the Norwegian people, has, he says,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
made the republic a remoter possibility than it was
ten years before (1875). But he qualifies this
statement with the significant condition, "If we
are not checked by fraud." And I fancy that he
would have a perfect right to justify his present
position by demonstrating the fraud, trickery, if
not treason, by which Norway has during the last
decade been thwarted in her aspirations and
checked in her development. That preface, by
the way, dated Paris, October, 1885, is one of the
most forceful and luminous of his political pronunciamientos.
It rings from beginning to end with
conviction and a manly indignation. His chief
purpose, he says, in writing this drama was, "to
extend the boundaries of free discussion." His
polemics against the clergy are not attacks upon
Christianity, though he contends that religion is
subject to growth as well as other things. The
ultimate form of government he believes to be the
republic, on the journey toward which all European
states are proceeding fast, or slow, and in
various stages of progress. There is something
abrupt, gnarled, Carlylese, in his urgent admonitions
and appeals for fair-play. The personal note
is so distinct that I cannot read the play without
unconsciously supplying the very cadence of Bj&ouml;rnson's
voice.</p>

<p>A further attempt to extend the boundaries of
free discussion is made in the two dramas, "Leonarda"
(1879) and "A Glove" (1883), which both
deal with interesting phases of the woman question,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
and both wage war against conventional notions of
right and wrong. The former elucidates the attitude
of society toward the woman who has been
compromised (whether justly or not), and the latter
its attitude toward the man. I confess there is
something a trifle hazy in his exposition of the
problem in "Leonarda;" and I am unable to determine
whether Leonarda really has anything to
reproach herself with or not. In her conversation
with the bishop in the second act, she appears to
admit that she has much to regret. She begs him
"help her atone for her past." She practically
throws herself upon his mercy, reminding him that
his Master, Christ, was the friend of sinners. But
in the last act she appears suddenly with the halo
of martyrdom. General Rosen, who has been the
cause of her social ostracism, turns out to be her
husband, whom she has divorced on account of his
dissipated habits, and now keeps, in the hope of
saving him, on a sort of probation. She believes
that without her he would go straight to perdition,
and from a sense of duty she tolerates him, not daring
to shirk her responsibility for the old reprobate's
soul. Truth to tell, she treats him like a
naughty boy, punishing him, when he has been
drunk, with a denial of favors; and when he has
been good, rewarding him with her company. I
suppose there are men who might be saved by such
treatment, but I venture to doubt whether they
are worth saving. As for Leonarda, she has apparently
no cause for encouragement. But she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
perseveres, heedless of obloquy, as long as her own
affections are disengaged. She presently falls in
love, however, with a young man named Hagbart
Tallhaug, who has insulted her and is now engaged
to her niece, Agot. Hagbart is the nephew of the
bishop of the diocese, who, after much persuasion
is induced to receive Agot, on condition that her
aunt will remove from the district and demand no
recognition from the family. Having been informed
of these conditions, Leonarda calls upon
the bishop, uninvited, and vainly remonstrates with
him. The young people are, however, unwilling
to accept happiness on the terms offered by his
reverence. At this point a new complication
arises. Hagbart who had loved in Agot a kind of
reflection of her aunt's character and manner, being
now thrown into the company of the latter, discovers
his mistake and transfers his affection to
Leonarda. Exactly wherein the newness of Leonarda's
type consists we are not fully informed, but
we are led to infer that she represents a purer and
truer humanity than the women bred in the traditions
of feudalism, with their hypocritical arts
and conventions. She is not meant to be seductive,
but radiant, ravishing.</p>

<p>There is a candor in her speech, and an almost
boyish straightforwardness, for which she is not
indebted to nature but to the stanch idealism of
her creator. She is, however, on that account no
less impressionable, no less ready to respond to the
call of love. She struggles manfully (or ought I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
not, in deference to the author's contention, to say
"womanfully") against her love for Hagbart, and
at last has no choice but to escape from the
cruel dilemma by accepting the bishop's demand.
Though she cannot conquer her affection for the
young man, she believes that he will, in the course
of time, return to Agot, as soon as she is out of his
way. The author evidently believes the same. It
is a hard lot to be a man in these later dramas of
Bj&ouml;rnson.</p>

<p>With a slight violation of the chronological sequence
I shall discuss "A Glove" in this connection,
because of its organic coherence with "Leonarda."
They are the obverse and reverse of the
same subject&mdash;the cruelty of society to the woman
of a blemished reputation, and its leniency to the
man.</p>

<p>To those who worship the conventional ideal of
womanly innocence "A Glove" will seem a very
shocking book, for it fearlessly discusses, and, what
is more, makes a young girl discuss&mdash;the standards
of sexual purity as applied to men and women.
The sentiments which she utters are, to be sure,
elevated and of an almost Utopian idealism; and
the author obviously means to raise, not to lower,
her in the eyes of the reader by her passionate
frankness.</p>

<p>The problem of the drama is briefly this: Society
demands of women an absolute chastity, and
refuses to condone the least lapse, either before or
after marriage. But toward men it is indulgent.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
It readily overlooks a plenteous seed of wild oats,
and would regard it as the sheerest Quixotism
to judge the bridegroom by the same standard of
purity as it does the bride. It is easy enough, and
perhaps also legitimate, to exclaim with Bj&ouml;rnson
that this is all wrong, and that a man has no
right to ask any more than he gives. As a mere
matter of equity a wife owes her husband no more
fidelity than he owes her, and may exact of him, if
she chooses, the same prematrimonial purity that
he exacts of her. But questions of this kind are
never settled on the basis of equity. The sentiments
by which they are determined have long
and intricate roots in the prehistoric past; and
we are yet very far from the millennial condition of
absolute equality between the sexes. According to
Herbert Spencer there is a hereditary transmission
of qualities which are confined exclusively to the
male, and of others which are confined to the female;
and these are the results of the primitive environments
and conditions which were peculiar to
each sex. Even the best of us have a reminiscent
sense of proprietorship in our wives, dating from
the time when she was obtained by purchase or
capture and could be disposed of like any other
chattel. Wives, whose prehistoric discipline has
disposed them to humility and submission (I am
speaking of the European, not the American species,
of course), have not yet in the same degree acquired
this sense of ownership in their husbands, involving
the same strict accountability for affectional<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
aberrations. And for this there is a very good reason,
which is no less valid now than it was in the
hoariest antiquity. A husband's infidelity, though
morally as reprehensible as that of the wife, does
not entail quite such monstrous consequences. For
if she deceives him, he may ignorantly bring up
another man's children, toil for them, bestow his
name and affection upon them, and leave them his
property. One can scarcely conceive of a more
outrageous wrong than this; and it is in order to
guard against such a possibility that society from
remote ages has watched over the chastity of women
far more jealously than over that of men. It
is as a result of this vigilance of centuries that
women have, among civilized nations, a finer sense
of modesty than men, and a higher standard of
personal purity. Men are, as yet, as Mr. Howells
remarks, "imperfectly monogamous;" and Bj&ouml;rnson
is, no doubt, in the main right in the tremendous
indictment he frames against them in the
present drama.</p>

<p>It may be expedient to give a brief outline of
the action. Svava Riis, the daughter of prosperous
and refined parents, becomes engaged to Alf
Christensen, the son of a great commercial magnate.</p>

<p>Her father and mother are overjoyed at the
happy event; she is herself no less delighted. Her
<i>fianc&eacute;</i> has an excellent reputation, shares her interest
in social questions, and supports her in her
efforts to found kindergartens and to ameliorate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span>
the lot of the poor. Each glories in the exclusive
possession of the other's love, and with the retrospective
jealousy of lovers, fancies that he has had
no predecessors in the affection of the beloved.
Alf can scarcely endure to have any one touch
Svava, and is almost ill when any one dances
with her.</p>

<p>"When I see you among all the others," he exclaims,
"and catch, for instance, a glimpse of your
arm, then I think: That arm has been wound
about my neck, and about no one else's in the
whole world. She is mine! She belongs to me,
and to no one, no one else!"</p>

<p>Svava finds this feeling perfectly natural, and
reciprocates it. She ardently believes that he
brings her as fresh a heart as she brings him; that
his past is as free from contaminating experience
as is her own. When, therefore, she obtains proof
to the contrary, in an indignant revulsion of feeling,
she hurls her glove in his face and breaks
the engagement. This act is, I fancy, intended
to be half symbolic. The young girl expresses
not only her personal sense of outrage; but she
flings a challenge in the face of the whole community,
which by its indulgence made his transgression
easy. She discovers that what in her would
have been a crime is in him a lapse, readily forgiven.
Her whole soul revolts against this inequality
of conditions; and in terminating their
relation, which has lost all its beauty, she wishes to
cut off all chance of its future resumption.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>In order to determine whether this sentiment of
passionate virginity (which in effect makes the
marriage vow of fidelity retroactive) is not, in the
present condition of the world, a trifle overstrained,
I have submitted the question to two refined women
for whom I have a high regard. To my surprise
they both declared that Svava, whatever she
may have said to the contrary, did not love her
<i>fianc&eacute;</i>; that her sorrow and even her indignation
were just and natural; but that her somewhat
over-conscious purity&mdash;her <i>virginit&eacute; savante</i>, as
Balzac phrases it in "Modeste Mignon," and her
inability to give due weight to ameliorating circumstances
were unwomanly. I confess I am not
without sympathy with this criticism. Svava,
though she is right in her vehement protest
against masculine immorality, is not charming&mdash;that
is, according to our present notion of what
constitutes womanly charm. It is not unlikely,
however, that like Leonarda she is meant to anticipate
a new type of womanhood, co-ordinate and coequal
with man, whose charm shall be of a wholly
different order. The coquetry, the sweet hypocrisy,
nay, all the frivolous arts which exercise such a potent
sway over the heart of man have their roots in
the prehistoric capture and thraldom; and from the
point of view of the woman suffragists, are so many
reminiscences of degradation. I fancy that Bj&ouml;rnson,
sharing this view, has with full deliberation
made Svava boldly and inexorably truthful, frank
as a boy and as uncompromisingly honest as a man.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span></p>

<p>She has sufficient use for this masculine equipment
(I am speaking in accordance with the effete
standards) in the battle which is before her. Dr.
Nordan, the family physician, her parents, and
those of her <i>fianc&eacute;</i>, take her to task and endeavor to
demonstrate to her the consequences of her unprecedented
demand. She learns in the course of this
prolonged debate that she has been living in a
fool's paradise. She has been purposely (and with
the most benevolent intention) deceived in regard
to this question from the very cradle. Her father,
whom she has believed to be a model husband,
proves to have been unworthy of her trust. The
elder Christensen has also had a compromising intrigue
of the same kind; and it becomes obvious
that each male creature is so indulgent in this
chapter toward every other male creature, because
each knows himself to be equally vulnerable.
There is a sort of tacit freemasonry among them,
which takes its revenge upon him who tells tales
out of school. It is a consciousness of this which
makes Christensen, after having declared war to
the knife against the Riises, withdraw his challenge
and become doubly cordial toward his enemy.
Alf, who in the second act has expressed
the opinion that a man is responsible to his wife for
his future, but not for his past, retracts, and does
penance. Svava, in consideration of his penitence,
gives him a vague hope of future reconciliation.<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_9_9" id="Footnote_9_9"></a><a href="#FNanchor_9_9"><span class="label">[9]</span></a> In the later acting version of the play, which ends with the
throwing of the glove, this hope of reconciliation is definitely cut
off. The author has evidently come to the conclusion that his argument
is weakened by Svava's conciliatory attitude, and he enforces
his moral by making the sin appear unpardonable. The
acting version, which is more dramatically concise, differs in several
other respects from the version here presented; but the other
changes seem to be dictated by a stricter regard for the exigencies
of theatrical representation. The play has been translated into
English under the title, "A Gauntlet," London, 1894.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p></div>

<p>It will be observed by every reader of "A Glove"
that it is not a drama, according to our American
notion. It has very little dramatic action. It
might be styled a series of brilliant and searching
debates concerning a theme of great moment. The
same definition applies, though in a lesser degree,
to "The New System" (1879), a five-act play of
great power and beauty. By power I do not mean
noise, but convincing impressiveness and concentration
of interest. One could scarcely imagine
anything farther removed from the ha! and ho!
style of melodrama.</p>

<p>"The New System" is primarily social satire.
It is a psychological analysis of the effect of the
"small state" upon its citizens. It is an expansion
and exemplification of the proposition (Act I., 1)
that "while the great states cannot subsist without
sacrificing their small people by the thousands,
small states cannot subsist without the sacrifice of
many of their great men, nay of the very greatest."
The smooth, crafty man, "who can smile ingratiatingly
like a woman," rises to the higher heights;
while the bold, strong, capable man, who is unversed
in the arts of humility and intrigue, struggles hopelessly,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
and perhaps in the end goes to the dogs, because
he is denied the proper field for his energy.
Never has Bj&ouml;rnson written anything more convincing,
penetrating, subtly satirical. He cuts deep;
every incision draws blood. A Norwegian who
reads the play cannot well rid himself of a startled
sense of exposure that is at first wounding to his
patriotism. It is mortifying to have to admit that
things are thus in Norway. And the worst of it is
that there appears to be no remedy. The condition
is, according to Bj&ouml;rnson, inherent in all small
states which cripple the souls of men, stunt their
growth, and contract their horizon.</p>

<p>The first act opens with a conversation between
the civil engineers Kampe and Ravn, and the former's
son Hans, who has just returned from a prolonged
sojourn abroad. The keynote is struck in
the sarcastic remark of Ravn, that in a small society
only small truths can be tolerated&mdash;of the
kind that takes twenty to the inch; but great truths
are apt to be explosive and should therefore be
avoided, for they might burst the whole society.
This is <i>&agrave; propos</i> of a book which Hans Kampe has
written, exposing the wastefulness and antiquated
condition of the so-called "new system" of railway
management introduced, or supposed to have been
introduced, by Kampe's and Ravn's brother-in-law,
the supervisor-general Riis. The way for Hans to
make a career, declares the worldly wise Ravn, is not
to oppose the source of promotion and power, but to
be silent and marry the supervisor-general's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
daughter. Ravn has learned this lesson by bitter experience,
and hopes that his nephew will profit by it.
All talk about duty to the state and society he pretends
to regard as pure moonshine, and he professes
not to see the connection between the elder Kampe's
drunkenness and the artificial bottling up to which
he has been subjected, the curbing and jailing of
Titanic powers which once sought outlet in significant
action. The same mighty force which in its
repression drives the men to the brandy-bottle
makes the women intoxicate themselves with fictitious
narratives of high courage, daring rescues,
and all kinds of melodramatic heroism. Extremely
amusing is the scene in which Karen Riis (who
loves Hans and is beloved by him) goes rowing
with her friends Nora and Lisa, taking with her a
stock of high-strung novels, and when a drowning
man cries to them for help they row away posthaste,
because the man is naked.</p>

<p>The second act shows us the type of the successful
man of compromise, who takes the world as he
finds it, and cleverly utilizes the foibles of his fellow-men.
The supervisor-general is a sort of personification
of public opinion. He is always correct,
professes to believe what others believe, and
conforms from prudent calculation to the religious
customs of the community. He demands of
his son Frederic that he shall abandon a young
girl whom he loves and has seduced, and he requires
of his daughter Karen that she shall, out of regard
for her family, renounce her lover. He feigns all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
proper sentiments and emotions, while under the
smooth, agreeable mask lurk malice and cunning.
When Hans Kampe's book reaches him, it never
occurs to him to examine it on its merits; his only
thought is to make it harmless by inventing a
scandalous motive. The elder Kampe has just resigned
from the railway service; the supervisor-general
(with infamous shrewdness) demands an
official inquiry into the state of his accounts.
Then all the world will say that Hans Kampe has
been used as a cat's-paw by his father, who, knowing
that an investigation is inevitable, wishes to
throw dust in the eyes of the public and save his
own reputation by attacking that of his superior.
It is needless to say that he has not a shadow of
suspicion regarding Kampe's honesty, but merely
chooses for his own defence the weapon which he
knows to be the most effective.</p>

<p>In order to fortify his position and sound the
sentiment of the profession, Riis gives a grand
dinner to the engineers of the city, to which
Kampe and his son are also invited. The chairman
of the committee on railways (of the national
diet) is present, and when it appears that Hans
Kampe makes a favorable impression upon him, the
friends of Riis concoct a scheme to injure him.
They inform his father that he is suspected of embezzlement,
and get him drunk, whereupon the
old man scandalizes the company by a burst of uncomplimentary
candor. When Hans arrives the
mischief is done; though the pathetic scene between<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
father and son convinces the chairman that,
whatever their failings, these men are true and
genuine. Simply delicious is the satire in the scene
where the ladies discuss the question at issue between
Riis and Kampe. But this satire is deprived
of much of its force by the subsequent development
of the plot. The logical ending would seem to be
the triumph of the supervisor-general's defensive
tactics and the discomfiture of his critics. That
would have given point to the criticism of the
small state and invested the victims of progress
with an almost tragic dignity. Bj&ouml;rnson chooses,
however, to let neither the one party nor the
other triumph. In a small state, he says, no
one is victorious; everything ends in compromise.
If two parties championed two different plans of
railway construction, the one of which was demonstrated
to be superior in economy and safety to
the other, such a demonstration would not be
likely to result in its adoption. No, the two
parties would come together, dicker and compromise,
and in the end the diet would agree to
build one road according to the one plan, and one
according to the other. Agreeably to this principle
Bj&ouml;rnson leaves the honors between the combatants
about easy; but Riis, deserted by his children,
undergoes a partial change of heart and is
seized with doubt as to the excellence of his philosophy
of life.</p>

<p>That the satire of "The New System" struck
home is obvious from the fierceness and virulence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
of the criticism with which it was hailed. It has
never become fairly domesticated on the Scandinavian
stages, and probably never will be. In Germany,
France, and Holland it has received respectful
attention, and (I am informed) has proved extremely
effective upon the boards.</p>

<p>In the same year as "The New System" (1879)
appeared the delightful novelette "Captain Mansana,"
dealing with Italian life, and throwing interesting
side-lights upon the War of Liberation.
There is an irresistible charm in the freshness, the
vividness, the extreme modernness of this little
tale. The mingled simplicity and sophistication
of the Italian character, the histrionic touch which
yet goes with perfect sincerity, the author has apprehended
and presented with happy realism.</p>

<p>In "Beyond their Strength" (<i>Over Aevne</i>)
(1883) Bj&ouml;rnson has invaded the twilight realm
of psycho-pathological phenomena, and refers the
reader for further information to <i>Le&ccedil;ons sur le syst&egrave;me
nerveux, faites par J. M. Charcot</i>, and <i>&Eacute;tudes
cliniques sur l'hyst&eacute;ro-&eacute;pilepsie ou grande hyst&eacute;rie,
par le Dr. Richer</i>. As a man is always in danger
of talking nonsense in dealing with a subject concerning
which his knowledge is superficial, I shall
not undertake to pronounce upon the validity of
the theory which is here advanced. The play is
an inquiry into the significance and authenticity
of miracles. Incidentally the theme is faith-healing,
the hypnotic effect of prayer, and kindred
phenomena.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span></p>

<p>Pastor Sang, a clergyman in a remote parish of
Northern Norway, is famed far and wide as the
miracle-priest, and it is popularly believed that he
can work wonders, as the apostles did of old. He
has given away his large fortune to the poor; in a
fervor of faith he plunges into every danger, and
comes out unscathed; he lives constantly in an
overstrained ecstasy, and by his mere presence, and
the atmosphere which surrounds him, forces his
wife and children to live in the same state of high
nervous tension and unnatural abstraction from
mundane reality and all its concerns. His wife,
Clara, who loves him ardently, is gradually worn
out by this perpetual strain, which involves a daily
overdraft upon her vitality; and finally the break
comes, and she is paralyzed. For, like everyone
who comes in contact with Sang, she has had to
live "beyond her strength." She does not fully
share her husband's faith, and though she feels his
influence and admires his lofty devotion, there is a
half-suppressed criticism in her mind. She feels
the unwholesomeness of thus "living by inspiration,
and not by reason." When he comes to her,
"beaming always with a Sabbath joy," she would
fain tune him down, if she could, into a lower key,
"the C-major of every-day life," as Browning calls
it. But in this effort she has had no success, for
Sang's ecstatic elevation above the concerns of
earth is not only temperamental; nature itself, in
the extreme North, favors it. As Clara expresses
it:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nature here exceeds the limits of the ordinary.
We have night nearly all winter; we have day
nearly all summer&mdash;and then the sun is above the
horizon, both day and night. Have you seen it in
the night? Do you know that behind the ocean
vapors it often looks three or four times as large as
usual? And then the color-effects upon sky, sea,
and mountain! From the deepest glow of red to
the finest, tenderest, golden white. And the colors
of the aurora upon the wintry sky!" etc.</p>

<p>It is the most ardent desire of Sang to heal his
wife, as he has healed many others. But the
doubt in her mind baffles him, and for a long time
he is unsuccessful. At last, however, he resolves
to make a mighty effort&mdash;to besiege the Lord with
his prayer, to wrestle with him, as Jacob did of
old, and not to release him, until he has granted
his petition. While he lies thus before the altar
calling upon the Lord in sacred rapture, a tremendous
avalanche sweeps down the mountainside,
but divides, leaving the church and parsonage
unharmed. The rumor of this new wonder spreads
like fire in withered grass, and among thousands
of others a number of clergymen, with their bishop,
on their way to some convention, stop to convince
themselves of the authenticity of the miracle, and
to determine the attitude which they are to assume
toward it. Then follows a long discussion between
the bishop and the clergy regarding the value of
miracles, some maintaining that the church has
outgrown the need of them, others that they are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
indispensable&mdash;that Christianity cannot survive
without them. For has not Christ promised that
"even greater things than these shall ye do?" Is
not this a case of the faith which verily can say to
the mountain, "Rise up and cast thyself into the
sea?"</p>

<p>The other miracle, scarcely less marvellous than
the deflection of the avalanche, is that Clara, who
has slept for the first time in a month, now rises
from her bed and goes forth to meet her husband,
and falls upon his neck amid the ringing of the
church-bells and the hallelujahs of the assembled
multitudes. But when he tries to raise her she is
dead, and he himself, overwhelmed by his emotion,
falls dead at her side.</p>

<p>This is so obviously a closet-drama that it is difficult
to imagine how it would look under the illumination
of the foot-lights. For all that, I see a
recent announcement that the trial is soon to be
made at the <i>Th&eacute;&acirc;tre Libre</i> in Paris.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> No Scandinavian
theatre, as far as I know, has as yet had the
courage to risk the experiment. In his next play,
however, "Love and Geography" (1885), Bj&ouml;rnson
reconquered the stage and repeated his early triumphs.
From the scientific seriousness of "Beyond
their Strength" his pendulum swung to the opposite
extreme of light comedy, almost bordering on
farce. Not that "Love and Geography" is without
a Bj&ouml;rnsonian moral, but it is amusingly,
jocosely enforced in scenes of great vivacity and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
theatrical effect. This time it is himself the
author has chosen to satirize. The unconscious
tyranny of a man who has a mission, a life-work,
is delightfully illustrated in the person of the
geographer, Professor Tygesen, to whom Bj&ouml;rn
Bj&ouml;rnson, the actor, when he played the part at the
Christiania Theatre, had the boldness to give his
father's mask. Professor Tygesen is engaged upon
a great geographical opus, and gradually takes possession
of the whole house with his maps, globes,
and books, driving his wife from the parlor floor
and his daughter to boarding-school. So absorbed
is he in his work that he can talk and think of
nothing else. He neglects the social forms from
sheer abstraction and becomes almost a boor, because
all the world outside of his book pales into
insignificance, and all persons and events are merely
interesting in so far as they can stimulate inquiry
or furnish information bearing upon the immortal
opus. The inevitable consequence follows. The
professor alienates all who come in contact with
him. He is on the point of losing the affection of
his wife, and his daughter comes near going astray
for want of paternal supervision. Both these calamities
are, however, averted, though in an arbitrary
and highly eccentric manner. The professor's
eyes are opened to the error of his ways,
he does penance, and the curtain falls upon a reunited
family.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_10_10" id="Footnote_10_10"></a><a href="#FNanchor_10_10"><span class="label">[10]</span></a> July, 1894.</p></div>

<p>The unpretentious little story "Dust" (<i>St&ouml;v</i>,
1882) undertakes to demonstrate the unwholesomeness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
of the religious ideas regarding the life to
come usually impressed upon children by parents
and teachers. By dust Bj&ouml;rnson means all obsolete,
lifeless matter in the world of thought which
settles upon, and often impairs, the vitality of the
living growth, or even chokes it outright. "When
children are taught that the life here is nothing
compared to the life to come&mdash;that to be visible is
nothing compared to being invisible&mdash;that to be a
man is nothing compared to being an angel&mdash;that to
be alive is nothing compared to being dead&mdash;then
that is not the way to give them the right view
of life; not the way to teach them to love life;
not the way to inspire them with courage, energy,
and patriotism."</p>

<p>In his novel "Flags in City and Harbor" (1884),
the English translation of which is entitled "The
Heritage of the Kurts," Bj&ouml;rnson has attacked a
tremendous problem. He has attempted to illustrate
the force of heredity, and the exact extent
to which it may be modified by environment&mdash;to
what extent an unfavorable heredity may be counteracted
by a favorable environment. The family
of Kurt, whose history is here traced through five
generations, inherits a temperament which would
have secured its survival and raised it to distinction
in barbaric ages, but which will as surely, unless
powerfully modified, necessitate its extinction
in the present age. For the Kurts are incapable
of assimilating civilization. An excess of physical
vigor in the first Kurt who settled in Norway takes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
the form of lawlessness and an entire absence of
moral restraint.</p>

<p>Violence of the most atrocious kind goes unpunished
because Kurt is powerful and has friends at
court. In his two legitimate sons, Adler and Max
(he has a host of illegitimate ones), the family
temperament is modified, though in Max, who perpetuates
the race, the modification is not radical.
Adler is a weakling of enormous vanity, silent and
moody, and addicted to the pleasures of the table.
Max, on the other hand, is a man of inexhaustible
vitality, violent like his father, but possessed of a
gift of speech and a tremendous voice which serve
to establish his authority over the simple inhabitants
of the little coast town. Moreover, he is
endowed with great shrewdness and practical sense,
and is an expert in ship-building, agriculture, and
other pursuits. But he is the terror of women,
and his sensual excesses so undermine his strength
that he becomes insane, and believes that he is continually
pursued by the spirit of his brother, whose
death he had caused. Konrad Kurt, the son of
Max, runs away from home because he cannot endure
to see his mother maltreated by his father.
He inherits a shattered constitution and poor
nerves; outwardly he is quite a respectable man,
but he has a strong physical need of drink, and
every night he goes to bed intoxicated. It is the
author's purpose to show how the sins of his fathers,
by a physiological necessity, predisposed Konrad
Kurt to drink. His son, John Kurt, who is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
the result of a criminal relation, is the complete
incarnation of the genius of the family. The fresh
blood which he has derived from his English
mother has postponed the doom of the race and
enabled him to repeat, in a modified form, the excesses
of his ancestors. He first distinguishes himself
as a virtuoso in swearing. The magnificent
redundance and originality of his oaths make him
famous in the army, which he chooses as the first
field of his exploits. Later he roams aimlessly
about the world, merely to satisfy a wild need of
adventure. On his return to his native town he
signalizes himself by his vices as a genuine Kurt.
The little town, however, cannot find it in its heart
to condemn a man of so distinguished a race, and
society, though it is fully cognizant of his mode of
life, not only tolerates but even pets him. He is
entertaining, has been everywhere and seen everything.
He meets a young girl, named Thomasine
Rendalen, the daughter of an educated peasant,
who occupies a position as a teacher. She is large,
ruddy, full of health and uncorrupted vigor. John
Kurt takes a violent fancy to her, and moves
heaven and earth to induce her to marry him. He
goes even to the length of bribing all her female
friends, and they by degrees begin to sing his
praises. At last she yields; a net of subtle influences
surrounds her, and unconsciously she comes
to reflect the view of society. Her moral prudery
begins to appear ridiculous to her, and the so-called
common-sense view predominates. The author<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
here, with great earnestness, emphasizes the
responsibility of society in weakening the moral
resistance of the individual rather than strengthening
it. Thomasine Rendalen would not have married
John Kurt if society had not condoned his
offences; and society in condoning such offences
undermines its own foundations.</p>

<p>After his marriage Kurt endeavors to hold his
exuberant nature in check, and for a while is moderately
successful. But an uneasy suspicion haunts
him that his wife's friends, in a confidential moment,
may expose his delinquencies, and destroy
her confidence in him. He watches her like a
lynx, surprises her at all hours and places, and
thereby produces the suspicion which he is endeavoring
to avert. The relation develops with inevitable
logic toward an awful crisis. This is brought
about by a mere trifle. John Kurt, failing to
humble his wife, strikes her. The baleful forces
that lurk in the depths of the Kurt temperament
rise to the surface; the whole terrible heritage of
savagery overwhelms the feeble civilization which
the last scion has acquired. If Thomasine had
been weak, she would have been killed; but she
defends herself with fierce persistency, and though
it seems as if she must succumb, her compact
frame, strengthened by generations of healthful
toil, possesses an endurance which in the end must
prevail over the paroxysmal rage of John Kurt.
When the combatants part there is not a whole
piece of furniture in the room. John Kurt retires<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
a conquered man. But with cowardly viciousness
he locks the door and leaves his wife for hours despairing,
while he himself goes to a dinner-party.
There he is stricken down by apoplexy.</p>

<p>The terror with which Thomasine contemplates
her approaching maternity is one of the finest
points in the book. Has she the right to perpetuate
such a race, which will be a curse to itself and
to future generations? Would she not confer a
boon upon mankind if, by destroying herself, she
sweetened the life-blood of humanity? For by
self-destruction she would forever cut off the turbid
current of the Kurt blood which had darkened
the vital stream of the race for centuries. The
moral exaltation which manifests itself in this
struggle is most vividly portrayed. She clings to
life desperately; she is young and strong, unsentimental,
and averse to ascetic enthusiasm. It finally
occurs to her that her own race, too, will assert
itself in this child; that the pure and vigorous
strain which her own blood will infuse may redeem
it from the dark destiny of the Kurts. She finally
resolves upon a compromise; if the child is dark,
like the Kurts, both it and its mother shall die.
If it is blue-eyed and light-haired, like the Rendalens,
she will devote her life to obliterating in it, or
transforming into useful activities, the destructive
vigor of the paternal character. Thomas, when he
is born, chooses a golden mean between these two
extremes, and perversely makes his appearance as
a red-haired, gray-eyed infant, in which both a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
Kurt and a Rendalen might have made comforting
observations. He is accordingly permitted to live,
and to become the hero of one of the most remarkable
novels which has ever been published in Scandinavia.</p>

<p>He is by no means a good boy, but his mother,
by a kind of heroic conscientiousness and rationality,
slowly conquers him and secures his attachment.
She has solemnly abjured her connection
with her husband's family, assumed her maiden
name, and has consecrated her life to what she regards
as the highest utility&mdash;the work of education.
She wishes to atone to the race for her guilt in
having perpetuated the race of the Kurts. The
scene in which she makes a bonfire of all the ancestral
portraits in the Hall of Knights, and the
smell of all the burning Kurts is blown far and
wide over city and harbor, would, in the hands of
another novelist, have been made the central scene
in the book. But Bj&ouml;rnson is so tremendously in
earnest that he cannot afford to stop and note picturesque
effect. Therefore he relates the burning
of the Kurts quite incidentally, and proceeds at
once to talk of more serious things.</p>

<p>By turning the great, dusky, ancestral mansion
into a school, Mrs. Rendalen believes that she can
best settle the account of the Kurts with humanity.
All the latest, improved methods of education
are introduced. The Hall of Knights is
turned into a chemical laboratory, and the daylight
is allowed to pour unobscured into all its murky<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
recesses. Through the dim and lofty passage-ways
resounds the laughter of children; on the scenes
of so many hoary crimes the prattle of innocent
girls is heard; a multitude of scientific instruments
labor to demonstrate the laws of nature, and
to simplify the problem of existence which the
crimes of the Kurts had tended to complicate.
Thomas Rendalen, profoundly impressed as he is
with his responsibility as the last descendant of
such a race, takes up this educational mission with
a lofty humanitarian enthusiasm. He has spent
many years abroad in preparing himself for this
work, and possesses, like his great-grandfather, the
gift of lucid exposition. But his perpetual and
conscious struggle with his heritage makes him
nervous and ill-balanced. He conceives the idea,
fostered both by observation and by the study of
his own family history, that unchastity is the chief
curse of humanity, and the primal cause of the degeneracy
of races. He believes that the false modesty
which leaves young people in ignorance of one
of the most important natural functions is largely
responsible for the prevailing immorality, and he
advocates, as a remedy, fearless and searching physiological
study. His inaugural address as superintendent
of the school deals uncompromisingly with
this subject, and excites such universal indignation
that it comes near wrecking the promising enterprise.
A great speech in a small town, Bj&ouml;rnson
hints, is always more or less risky. But we are
also given to understand that though Rendalen obviously<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
speaks out of the author's heart, this very
speech is in itself a subtle manifestation of the
Kurt heritage. Rendalen is as immoderate in virtue
as his ancestors have been in vice. The violent
energy which formerly expended itself in lawless
acts now expends itself in an excessive, ascetic
enthusiasm for self-conquest and lofty humanitarian
ideals. As a piece of psychology this is admirable.
Prudent, well adapted or adaptable to
the civilization in which he lives, the scion of the
Kurts is not yet; but as a promise of the redemption
of the race he represents the first upward
step. It is highly characteristic of Bj&ouml;rnson's respect
for reality that he makes Rendalen neither
agreeable, handsome, nor lovable; nay, he dwells
again and again on the bad relations which temporarily
exist between him and his mother, between
him and the teachers, between him and the town.
For all that we are filled with a profound respect
for a man who can fight in himself so great a
fight, and win so great a victory. It is the sturdy
peasant blood which he derived from his mother
that enables him to wrestle thus mightily with the
Lord, and extort at last the tardy blessing; for we
are assured in the last pages of the book that he
makes a marriage, which is a further step toward
health and virtue. We are not assured that he
conquers happiness either for himself or for his
wife; and there is not a syllable to betray that he
cherishes for her any romantic attachment. But
the chances are that, in transforming and ennobling<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
the Kurt heritage, he insures vigor and usefulness
to his descendants. He bequeathes to them a more
wholesome mixture of blood than he himself possesses,
and an energy, nay, perhaps a genius, derived
from the Kurts, which, with an upward instead
of a downward tendency, may be a redeeming
force in society instead of a corrupting one.</p>

<p>In order not to miss any phase of his problem,
Bj&ouml;rnson also takes up briefly the illegitimate line
of the Kurts, which, being unsupplied with any
favorable environment, sinks deeper and deeper
into the mire of vice. The inevitable result is insanity
and ultimate extinction. Mrs. Rendalen's
visit to the slums, and her recognition of the peculiar
scream of her own son in a terrible little
ragamuffin, is one of the most remarkable incidents
in this remarkable book.</p>

<p>One thing that especially strikes the reader in
this novel is the author's fierce indignation against
all shams, deceits, and social lies. Therefore he
calls a spade a spade, and leaves you to blush if
you are so inclined. The young girls whom he
introduces are mostly misses in their teens, and
his portrayal of them is physiological rather than
pictorial. The points which he selects for comment
are those which would particularly be noted
by their medical advisers; and the progress of
their histories, as he follows them, is characterized
by this same scientific minuteness of observation.
Zola's ideal of scientific realism (which
Bj&ouml;rnson has repudiated) has nevertheless found<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
its most brilliant exponent in him. Here the sordid
and cruel facts of life are not dwelt upon by
preference; nor are they optimistically glossed
over. I doubt if a great and vital problem has
ever been more vigorously, unflinchingly, and
convincingly treated in a work of fiction.</p>

<p>"<i>Paa Guds Veje</i>" ("In the Ways of God"),
(1889), in which Thomas Rendalen again figures,
though not as hero, is another indictment of conventional
morality. It is a very powerful but
scarcely an agreeable book. The abrupt, laconic
style has no flux, no continuity, and gives the
reader the sensation of being pulled up sharply
with a curb bit, whenever he fancies that he has
a free rein. Though every page is crowded with
trenchant and often admirable observations, they
have not the coherence of an organic structure,
but rather that of a mosaic. The design is obvious,
striking, and impressive. It is neither distorted
nor overdrawn. It is unquestionably thus we
treat moral non-conformists, even though it be in
pure self-preservation that they broke the bond
which we are agreed to enforce. The question
resolves itself into this: Has society, in its effort
to uphold its moral standards, the right to exact
the sacrifice of life itself and every hope of happiness
from the victims of its own ignorance and
injustice? When the young physician, Edward
Kallem, rescues the eighteen-year old Ragni Kule
from the degradation of her marriage to a husband
afflicted with a most loathsome disease, and afterward<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
marries her&mdash;does he deserve censure or praise?
Bj&ouml;rnson's answer is unmistakable. It is exactly
the situation, depicted five years later, by Madame
Sarah Grand in the relation of Edith to the young
rake, Sir Moseley Menteith. Only, Bj&ouml;rnson rescues
the victim, while the author of "The Heavenly
Twins" makes her perish. In both instances
it is the pious ignorance of clerical parents which
precipitates the tragedy. Ragni's deliverance is,
however, only an apparent one. Society, which
without indignation had witnessed her sale to the
corrupt old libertine, is frightfully shocked by her
marriage to Dr. Kallem, and manifests its disapproval
with an emphasis which takes no account
of ameliorating circumstances. The sanguinary
ingenuity in the constant slights and stabs to which
she is exposed makes her life a martyrdom and
finally kills her. "Contempt will pierce the armor
of a tortoise," says an oriental proverb; and
poor Ragni had no chelonian armor. When her
most harmless remarks are misinterpreted and
her most generous acts become weapons wherewith
to slay her, she loses all heart for resistance,
and merely lies down to die. Very subtile and
beautiful is the manner in which Bj&ouml;rnson indicates
the interaction of psychical and physical
conditions. The "soul-frost" which chills the
very marrow of her bones is so vividly conveyed
that you shiver sympathetically. The self-righteous
and brutally censorious attitude of the community
lowers the temperature and makes the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
atmosphere deadly. And the fact that it is Ragni's
unsuspicious innocence, and even her love
of her husband, which expose her to this condemnation
is made plain with much delicate art.
Her residence of five years in the United States
after her divorce, and before her second marriage,
had, no doubt, accustomed her to a greater freedom
of intercourse between man and woman, and thereby
disposed her to trip rather lightly over the
stumbling-blocks of prudence.</p>

<p>The history of Kallem's sister, Josephine, and her
husband, the Reverend Ole Tuft, which is closely
interwoven with the above, furnishes us with two
more characters deeply felt and strongly realized.
It is they who are the chief instruments of Ragni's
martyrdom. As the upholders of social purity,
and, as it were, professional guardians of morals, it
would seem that Tuft and his wife had scarcely any
choice but to condemn marriage with a <i>divorc&eacute;e</i>.
When, however, after Ragni's death, they discover
whom they have slain&mdash;how much purer, nobler,
and of more delicate nature she was than either of
them&mdash;they are dissolved in shame and remorse. A
tremendous crisis in their spiritual lives is produced
by the mortal peril of their only child, whom
Kallem saves by a skilful operation. Out of the
ancient religion of dogmas which judges and damns,
Tuft is by these experiences led into a new religion
of love, which values life above faith, and charity
above all. The reconciliation of brother and sister
in the last chapter is profoundly moving. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
moral is emphasized in the phrase with which the
story closes: "Wherever good men walk, there are
the ways of God."</p>

<p>The charm of this novel is, to me, that it is
strong, virile, instinct with vital thought. There
are blemishes in it, too, which no one will be likely
to overlook. Several chapters read like the reports
of a clinic in a medical journal, so extremely minute
and circumstantial are the accounts of Kallem's
operations and hypnotic experiments. An excursion
into botany, <i>&agrave; propos</i> of Ragni's walk in the
woods, is likewise overloaded with details and teems
with scientific terms. But the greatest blemish is
the outbreak in Kallem (who has the author's fullest
sympathy) of a certain barbaric violence which
to civilized people is well-nigh incomprehensible.
Thus, when, after an absence of six years, he calls
upon his brother-in-law, the pastor, he proceeds to
turn handsprings about the latter's study. When,
after his marriage, his sister meets him in the
street for the purpose of informing him of the
scandalous rumors concerning his wife, he gives
her a box on the ear.</p>

<p>In Bj&ouml;rnson's last book, "New Tales" (<i>Nye
Fortaellinger</i>) (1894), this tendency to vehemence
is even more marked. In the masterly story, "Absalom's
Hair" (than which the author has never
written anything more boldly original) old Harold
Kaas literally spanks his young wife in the presence
of his servants. And the matter is in nowise
minced, but described with an unblushing zest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
which makes the impression of <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i>. It is obvious
that in his delight in the exhibition of a
healthy, primitive wrath, Bj&ouml;rnson half forgets
how such barbarism must affect his readers. We
hear, to be sure, that the servants were filled with
indignation and horror, and that Harold Kaas,
having expected laughter and applause, "went
away a defeated and irremediably crushed man."
But for all that the incident is crude, harsh, and
needlessly revolting. In Russia it might have
happened; but I am inclined to doubt if a Norwegian
gentleman, even though he were descended
from the untamable Kurts, would have been capable
of so outrageous a breach of decency.</p>

<p>Apart from this incident, "Absalom's Hair" is
so interpenetrated with a sense of reality that we
seem to live the story rather than read it. I verily
believe it to be a type of what the fiction of the
future will be, when scientific education shall have
been largely substituted for the classical; and even
the novelists will be expected to know something
about the world in which they live and the sublime
and inexorable laws which govern it. At present
the majority of them spin irresponsible yarns, and
play Providence <i>ad libitum</i> to their characters.
Man's vital coherence with his environment is but
loosely indicated. Chance reigns supreme. They
have observed carefully enough the external phenomena
of life&mdash;and chiefly for their picturesque
or dramatic interest&mdash;but of the causes which underlie
them they rarely give us a glimpse.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>It is in this respect that Bj&ouml;rnson's last tales offer
so grateful a contrast to conventional fiction.
Here is a man who has resolutely aroused himself
from the old romantic doze, cleared his eyes of the
film of dreams, and with a sharp, wide-awake intensity
focussed them to the actual aspect of the
actual world. He has sat down with his windows
wide open, and allowed the sounds and sights and
smells of reality to pour in upon him. And the
magic spectacles are his which enable him to gauge
the significance of the phenomena and divine the
causes which lurk behind them. Therefore his
characterizations are often extremely unconventional,
and amid all their picturesque vigor of
phrase hint at the kind of knowledge which could
only be possessed by a family physician. In "Absalom's
Hair" we have no mere agglomeration of
half-digested scientific data, but a scientific view of
life. The story moves, from beginning to end, with
a beautiful epic calm and a grand inevitableness
which remind one of Tolstoi, and reaches far toward
the high-water mark of modern realism.
Take, for instance, the characterization of Kirsten
Ravn (pp. 11-15), and I wonder where in contemporary
fiction so large and deep a comprehension
is shown both of psychic and of physical forces.
Emma, the heroine of Flaubert's "Madame Bovary"
is the only parallel I can recall, as regards
the kind and method of portraiture, though there is
no resemblance between the characters. In the development
of the character of Rafael Kaas, there is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
the same beautiful respect for human nature, the
same unshrinking statement of "shocking" facts,
and the same undeviating adherence to the logic of
reality. The hair by which Rafael, as his prototype,
the son of David, is arrested and suspended
in the midst of his triumphant race is sensuality.
His life is on the point of being wrecked, and his
splendid powers are dissipated by his inability to
restrain his passions. The tragic fate which hovers
over him from the moment of his birth is admirably
hinted at, but not emphasized, in the sketch
of his parents. The carnal overbalance, supplied
by the blood of the Kurts, wellnigh neutralizes
the mechanical genius which is hereditary in the
blood of the Ravns.</p>

<p>It is reported that "Absalom's Hair" has aroused
great indignation in Christiania, because it is
claimed that the characters are drawn, with scarcely
an attempt at disguise, from well-known persons
in the Norwegian capital.</p>

<p>The remaining stories of the volume, "An Ugly
Reminiscence of Childhood," "Mother's Hands,"
and "One Day" betray the same contempt for romantic
standards, the same capacity for making
acquaintance with life at first hand. The first-named
is an account of a murder and execution,
and extremely painful. The second is a bit of
pathological psychology <i>&agrave; propos</i> of intemperance.
Tastes imprisoned, genius cramped and perverted,
joy of life (<i>joie de vivre</i>) denied, will avenge themselves.
They will break out in drunkenness. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
hero of "One Day" is afflicted with the same vice,
and apparently for the same reason. The cruel
disillusion which in consequence overtakes the poor
little soul-starved heroine rises almost to the height
of tragedy. It is an every-day tale, full of "deep
and blood-veined humanity," and deriving its interest
and significance from the very fact of its
commonness.</p>

<p>What distinguishes the Norsemen above other
nations is, generally speaking, an indestructible
self-respect and force of individuality. The old
Norse sagas abound in illustrations of this untamable
vigor and ruthless self-assertion. It was the
looseness of the social structure, resulting from
this sense of independence and consequent jealousy
and internecine warfare, which destroyed the Icelandic
republic and made Norway for four centuries
a province of Denmark. In all the great
men of Norway we recognize something of the
rampant individualism of their Viking forefathers.
Ibsen is the modern apostle <i>par excellence</i> of philosophic
anarchism; and Bj&ouml;rnson, too, has his full
share of the national aggressiveness and pugnacity.
For all that there is a radical difference between
the two. The sense of social obligation which
Ibsen lacks, Bj&ouml;rnson possesses in a high degree.
He fights, not as a daring guerilla, but as the
spokesman and leader of thousands. He is the
chieftain who looms a head above all the people.
He wields a heavy sword, and he deals mighty
blows. The wrath that possesses him is, however,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
born of love. He fights man in the name of humanity.
It is not for himself, primarily, that he
demands larger liberties, securer rights, more humanizing
conditions of life; but it is for his fellow-men.
The many, the small and down-trodden, the
dumb millions, whom Ibsen despises, Bj&ouml;rnson
loves. As Dr. Brandes<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> has so happily said:</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_11_11" id="Footnote_11_11"></a><a href="#FNanchor_11_11"><span class="label">[11]</span></a> Det Moderne Gjennembruds Maend, p. 60.</p></div>

<p>"Ibsen is a judge, stern as the old judges of
Israel. Bj&ouml;rnson is a prophet, the hopeful herald
of a better day. Ibsen is, in the depth of his mind,
a great revolutionist. In 'The Comedy of Love,'
'A Doll's House,' and 'Ghosts,' he scourges marriage;
in 'Brand,' the State Church; in the
'Pillars of Society,' the dominant bourgeoisie.
Whatever he attacks is shivered into splinters by
his profound and superior criticism. Only the
shattered ruins remain, and we are unable to espy
the new social institutions beyond them. Bj&ouml;rnson
is a conciliatory spirit who wages war without
bitterness. April sunshine glints and gleams
through all his works, while those of Ibsen, with
their sombre seriousness, lie in deep shadow.
Ibsen loves the idea&mdash;the logical and psychological
consistency which drives Brand out of the
church and Nora out of the marital relation. To
Ibsen's love of the idea corresponds Bj&ouml;rnson's love
of man."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<h2>ALEXANDER KIELLAND</h2>


<p>In June, 1867, about a hundred enthusiastic
youths were vociferously celebrating their attainment
of the baccalaureate degree at the University
of Norway. The orator on this occasion
was a tall, handsome, distinguished-looking young
man named Alexander Kielland, from the little
coast town of Stavanger. There was none of the
crudity of a provincial either in his manners or
his appearance. He spoke with a quiet self-possession
and a pithy incisiveness which were altogether
phenomenal.</p>

<p>"That young man will be heard from one of
these days," was the unanimous verdict of those
who listened to his clear-cut and finished sentences,
and noted the maturity of his opinions.</p>

<p>But ten years passed, and outside of Stavanger
no one ever heard of Alexander Kielland. His
friends were aware that he had studied law, spent
some winters in France, married, and settled himself
as a dignitary in his native town. It was understood
that he had bought a large brick and tile
factory, and that as a manufacturer of these useful
articles he bid fair to become a provincial magnate,
as his fathers had been before him. People<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
had almost forgotten that great things had been
expected of him, and some fancied perhaps that
he had been spoiled by prosperity. Remembering
him, as I did, as the most brilliant and notable
personality among my university friends, I began
to apply to him Mallock's epigrammatic damnation
of the man of whom it was said at twenty that he
would do great things, at thirty that he might do
great things, and at forty that he might have done
great things.</p>

<p>This was the frame of mind of those who remembered
Alexander Kielland (and he was an
extremely difficult man to forget), when in the
year 1879 a modest volume of "Novelettes" appeared,
bearing his name. It was, to all appearances,
a light performance, but it revealed a sense
of style which made it, nevertheless, notable. No
man had ever written the Norwegian language as
this man wrote it. There was a lightness of touch,
a perspicacity, an epigrammatic sparkle, and occasional
flashes of wit which seemed altogether un-Norwegian.
It was obvious that this author was
familiar with the best French writers, and had acquired
through them that clear and crisp incisiveness
of utterance which was supposed, hitherto, to
be untransferable to any other tongue.</p>

<p>As regards the themes of these "Novelettes,"
it was remarked at the time of their first appearance
that they hinted at a more serious purpose
than their style seemed to imply. Who can
read, for instance, "Pharaoh" (which in the original<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
is entitled "A Ball Mood") without detecting
the revolutionary note that trembles quite
audibly through the calm and unimpassioned language?
There is, by the way, a little touch of
melodrama in this tale which is very unusual with
Kielland. "Romance and Reality," too, is glaringly
at variance with conventional romanticism
in its satirical contrasting of the prematrimonial
and the postmatrimonial view of love and marriage.
The same persistent tendency to present
the wrong side as well as the right side&mdash;and not,
as literary good manners are supposed to prescribe,
ignore the former&mdash;is obvious in the charming
tale, "At the Fair," where a little spice of
wholesome truth spoils the thoughtlessly festive
mood; and the squalor, the want, the envy, hate,
and greed which prudence and a regard for business
compel the performers to disguise to the public,
become the more cruelly visible to the visitors
of the little alley-way at the rear of the tents. In
"A Good Conscience" the satirical note has a
still more serious ring; but the same admirable
self-restraint which, next to the power of thought
and expression, is the happiest gift an author's
fairy godmother can bestow upon him, saves Kielland
from saying too much&mdash;from enforcing his
lesson by marginal comments, <i>&aacute; la</i> George Eliot.
But he must be obtuse indeed to whom this reticence
is not more eloquent and effective than a
page of philosophical moralizing.</p>

<p>"Hope's Clad in April Green" and "The Battle<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
of Waterloo" (the first and the last tale in the
Norwegian edition) are more untinged with a
moral tendency than any of the foregoing. The
former is a mere <i>jeu d'esprit</i>, full of good-natured
satire on the calf-love of very young people, and
the amusing over-estimate of our importance to
which we are all, at that age, peculiarly liable.</p>

<p>As an organist with vaguely melodious hints
foreshadows in his prelude the musical <i>motifs</i>
which he means to vary and elaborate in his
fugue, so Kielland lightly touched in these "Novelettes"
the themes which in his later works he
has struck with a fuller volume and power. What
he gave in this little book was a light sketch of
his mental physiognomy, from which, perhaps,
his horoscope might be cast and his literary future
predicted.</p>

<p>Though a patrician by birth and training, he
revealed a strong sympathy with the toiling masses.
But it was a democracy of the brain, I should fancy,
rather than of the heart. As I read the book,
sixteen years ago, its tendency puzzled me considerably,
remembering, as I did, with the greatest
vividness, the fastidious and <i>distingu&eacute;</i> personality
of the author. I found it difficult to believe that he
was in earnest. The book seemed to me to betray
the whimsical <i>sans-culottism</i> of a man of pleasure
who, when the ball is at an end, sits down with his
gloves on, and philosophizes on the artificiality of
civilization and the wholesomeness of honest toil.
An indigestion makes him a temporary communist;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
but a bottle of seltzer presently reconciles him
to his lot, and restores the equilibrium of the universe.
He loves the people at a distance, can talk
prettily about the sturdy son of the soil, who is
the core and marrow of the nation, etc.; but he
avoids contact with him, and, if chance brings
them into contact, he loves him with his handkerchief
to his nose.</p>

<p>I may be pardoned for having identified Alexander
Kielland with this type, with which I am very
familiar; and he convinced me presently that I
had done him injustice. In his next book, the
admirable novel "Garman and Worse," he showed
that his democratic proclivities were something
more than a mood. He showed that he took himself
seriously, and he compelled the public to take
him seriously. The tendency which had only
flashed forth here and there in the "Novelettes"
now revealed its whole countenance. The author's
theme was the life of the prosperous <i>bourgeoisie</i> in
the western coast towns; and he drew their types
with a hand that gave evidence of intimate knowledge.
He had himself sprung from one of these
rich ship-owning, patrician families, had been given
every opportunity to study life both at home and
abroad, and had accumulated a fund of knowledge
of the world, which he had allowed quietly to
grow before making literary draughts upon it.
The same Gallic perspicacity of style which had
charmed in his first book was here in a heightened
degree; and there was, besides, the same underlying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
sympathy with progress and what is called the
ideas of the age. What mastery of description,
what rich and vigorous colors, Kielland had at his
disposal was demonstrated in such scenes as the
funeral of Consul Garman and the burning of the
ship. There was, moreover, a delightful autobiographical
note in the book, particularly in the boyish
experiences of Gabriel Garman. Such things
no man invents, however clever; such material no
imagination supplies, however fertile. Except
Fritz Reuter's Stavenhagen, I know no small town
in fiction which is so vividly and completely individualized,
and populated with such living and
credible characters. Take, for instance, the two
clergymen, Archdeacon Sparre and the Rev. Mr.
Martens, and it is not necessary to have lived in
Norway in order to recognize and enjoy the faithfulness
and the artistic subtlety of these portraits.
If they have a dash of satire (which I will not undertake
to deny), it is such delicate and well-bred
satire that no one, except the originals, would
think of taking offence. People are willing, for
the sake of the entertainment which it affords, to
forgive a little quiet malice at their neighbors' expense.
The members of the provincial bureaucracy
are drawn with the same firm but delicate
touch, and everything has that beautiful air of
reality which proves the world akin.</p>

<p>It was by no means a departure from his previous
style and tendency which Kielland signalized
in his next novel, "Laboring People" (1881).<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
He only emphasizes, as it were, the heavy, serious
bass chords in the composite theme which expresses
his complex personality, and allows the
lighter treble notes to be momentarily drowned.
His theme is the corrupting influence of the upper
upon the lower class. He has in this book made
some appalling, soul-searching studies in the pathology
as well as the psychology of vice.</p>

<p>Kielland's third novel, "Skipper Worse," marked
a distinct step in his development. It was less of
a social satire and more of a social study. It was
not merely a series of brilliant, exquisitely finished
scenes, loosely strung together on a slender thread
of narrative, but was a concise and well-constructed
story, full of beautiful scenes and admirable portraits.
The theme is akin to that of Daudet's
"L'&Eacute;vang&eacute;liste;" but Kielland, as it appears to
me, has in this instance outdone his French <i>confr&egrave;re</i>,
as regards insight into the peculiar character
and poetry of the pietistic movement. He has
dealt with it as a psychological and not primarily
as a pathological phenomenon. A comparison
with Daudet suggests itself constantly in reading
Kielland. Their methods of workmanship and
their attitude toward life have many points in
common. The charm of style, the delicacy of
touch, and felicity of phrase, are in both cases
pre-eminent. Daudet has, however, the advantage
(or, as he himself asserts, the disadvantage) of
working in a flexible and highly finished language,
which bears the impress of the labors of a hundred<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
masters; while Kielland has to produce his effects
of style in a poorer and less pliable language,
which often pants and groans in its efforts to render
a subtle thought. To have polished this
tongue and sharpened its capacity for refined and
incisive utterance, is one&mdash;and not the least&mdash;of
his merits.</p>

<p>Though he has by nature no more sympathy
with the pietistic movement than Daudet, Kielland
yet manages to get psychologically closer to
his problem. His pietists are more humanly interesting
than those of Daudet, and the little
drama which they set in motion is more genuinely
pathetic. Two superb figures&mdash;the lay preacher
Hans Nilsen and Skipper Worse&mdash;surpass all that
the author had hitherto produced in depth of conception
and brilliancy of execution. The marriage
of that delightful, profane old sea-dog Jacob
Worse with the pious Sara Torvestad, and the attempts
of his mother-in-law to convert him, are
described not with the merely superficial drollery
to which the subject invites, but with a sweet and
delicate humor which trembles on the verge of pathos.
In the Christmas tale, "Elsie," Kielland
has produced a little classic of almost flawless perfection.
With what exquisite art he paints the life
of a small Norwegian coast-town in all its vivid details!
While Bj&ouml;rnson, in "The Heritage of the
Kurts," primarily emphasizes the responsibility of
the individual to society, Kielland chooses to emphasize
the responsibility of society to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
individual. The former selects a hero with vicious inherited
tendencies, redeemed by wise education and
favorable environment; the latter portrays a heroine
with no corrupt predisposition, destroyed by a
corrupting environment. Elsie could not be good,
because the world was once so constituted that
girls of her kind were not expected to be good.
Temptations, perpetually thronging in her way,
broke down the moral bulwarks of her nature;
resistance seemed in vain. In the end, there is
scarcely one who, having read the book, will have
the heart to condemn her.</p>

<p>Incomparably clever is the satire on the benevolent
societies which exist to furnish a kind of officious
sense of virtue to their aristocratic members.
"The Society for the Redemption of the
Abandoned Women of St. Peter's Parish" is presided
over by a gentleman who is responsible for
the abandoned condition of a goodly number of
them. However, it turns out that those miserable
creatures who need to be redeemed belong to another
parish, and accordingly cannot be reached by
St. Peter's. St. Peter's parish is aristocratic, exclusive,
and keeps its wickedness discreetly veiled.
The horror of the secretary of the society, when
she hears that "the abandoned woman" who calls
upon her for aid, has a child without being married,
is both comic and pathetic. In fact, there is
not a scene in the book which is not instinct with
life and admirably characteristic.</p>

<p>Besides being the author of some minor comedies<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
and a full-grown drama ("The Professor"),
Kielland has published several novels, the more
recent being "Poison" (1883), "Fortuna" (1884),
"Snow" (1886), and "St. John's Eve" (1887).</p>

<p>The note of promise and suspense with which
"Snow" ends is meant to be symbolic. From
Kielland's point of view, Norway is yet wrapped in
the wintry winding-sheet of a tyrannical orthodoxy,
and all he dares assert is that the chains of
frost and snow seem to be loosening. There is a
spring feeling in the air.</p>

<p>This spring feeling is scarcely perceptible in his
last book, "Jacob" (1890), which is written in
anything but a hopeful mood. It is rather a protest
against that optimism which in fiction we call
poetic justice. The harsh and unsentimental logic
of reality is emphasized with a ruthless disregard
of rose-colored traditions.</p>

<p>From the pedagogic point of view, I have no
doubt that "Jacob" would be classed as an immoral
book. But the question of its morality is
of less consequence than the question of its truth.
The most modern literature, which is interpenetrated
with the spirit of the age, has a way of asking
dangerous questions&mdash;questions before which
the reader, when he perceives their full scope,
stands aghast. Our old idyllic faith in the goodness
and wisdom of all mundane arrangements has
undoubtedly received a shock. Our attitude toward
the universe is changing with the change of
its attitude toward us. What the thinking part of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
humanity is now largely engaged in doing is readjusting
itself toward the world and the world toward
it. Success is but adaptation to environment,
and success is the supreme aim of the modern man.
The authors who, by their fearless thinking and
speaking, help us toward this readjustment should,
in my opinion, whether we choose to accept their
conclusions or not, be hailed as benefactors. It is
in the ranks of these that Alexander Kielland has
taken his place, and occupies a conspicuous position.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<h2>JONAS LIE</h2>


<p>The last Norwegian novelist who is in the
Parisian sense <i>arriv&eacute;</i> is Jonas Lie.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> The <i>Figaro</i>
has occupied itself with him of late; and
before long, I venture to predict, London and
New York will also have discovered him. English
versions of a few of his earlier novels appeared,
to be sure, twenty years ago&mdash;in very bad
translations&mdash;and accordingly attracted no great
attention. "The Visionary," which has recently
been published in London, has had better luck,
having been accorded a flattering reception. Of
its popular success it is yet too early to speak.
But even if Jonas Lie were not about to knock at
our gates, I venture to say that I shall earn the
gratitude of many a reader by making him acquainted
with this rare, complex, and exceedingly
modern spirit. For Jonas Lie is not (like so many
of his brethren of the quill) a mere inoffensive
gentleman who spins yarns for a living, but he is
a forceful personality of bright perceptions and
keen sensations, which has chosen to express itself
through the medium of the novel. He dwells in
a many-windowed house, with a large outlook upon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
the world and its manifold concerns. In a score
of novels of varying degrees of excellence he has
given us vividly realized bits of the views which
his windows command. But what lends their
chief charm to these uncompromising specimens
of modern realism is a certain richness of temperament
on the author's part, which suffuses even
the harshest narrative with a rosy glow of hope.
Though, generally speaking, there is no very close
kinship between him and the French realists, I am
tempted to apply to him Zola's beautiful characterization
of Daudet: "Benevolent Nature placed
him at that exquisite point where reality ends and
poetry begins." Before he had yet written a single
book, except a volume of flamboyant verse,
Bj&ouml;rnson said of him in a public speech: "His
friends know that he only has to plunge his landing-net
down into himself in order to bring it up
full."</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_12_12" id="Footnote_12_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_12"><span class="label">[12]</span></a> Pronounced <i>Lee</i>.</p></div>

<p>The man who, in anticipation of his achievements,
impressed Bj&ouml;rnson so deeply with his
genius, was, however, by others, who felt themselves
to be no less entitled to an opinion, regarded
as an "original," not to say a fool. That
he was decidedly queer, his biography by Arne
Garborg amply testifies.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Two souls, alas, abide within my breast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The one forever strives against the other,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>says Faust; and Jonas Lie's life and literary activity
are apparently, in a very real sense, the result<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
of a similar warfare. There was, indeed, a good
ancestral reason for the duality of his nature. His
father, a judge of sterling ability and uprightness,
was descended, but a few generations back, from
sturdy, blond, Norwegian peasants; while his
mother was of Finnish, or possibly Gypsy, descent.
I remember well this black-eyed, eccentric
little lady, with her queer ways, extraordinary
costumes, and still more extraordinary conversation.
It is from her Jonas Lie has inherited the
fantastic strain in his blood, the strange, superstitious
terrors, and the luxuriant wealth of color
which he lavished upon his poems and his first
novel, "The Visionary." From his paternal ancestors,
who were for three generations judges and
judicial functionaries, he has derived his good
sense, his intense appreciation of detail, and his
strong grip on reality. His career represents at
its two poles a progression from the adventurous
romanticism of his maternal heritage to the severe,
wide-awake realism of the paternal&mdash;the emancipation
of the Norseman from the Finn.</p>

<p>"Jonas Lie has a good memory," writes his
biographer. "Thus he remembers&mdash;even though
it be as through a haze&mdash;that he was once in the
world as the son of a laborer, a carpenter, or something
in that line, and that he went with food in
a tin-pail to his father, when he was at work.
During this incarnation he must have behaved
rather shabbily; for in the next he found himself
degraded to a fox&mdash;a silver fox&mdash;and in this capacity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
he was shot one moonlight night on the snow.
After that he emerged, according to his recollection,
as Jonas Lauritz Idemil, son of the lawyer
Mons Lie, at Hougsund, in Eker. This took place
November 6, 1833."</p>

<p>When he was but a few years old his father removed,
in various official capacities, to Mandal,
S&ouml;ndhordland, and, finally, to the city of Tromsoe,
in Nordland. It was here, in the extreme
north, that Jonas spent the years of his boyhood,
and it was this wild, enchanted region which put
the deepest impress upon his spirit.</p>

<p>"In Nordland," he says in "The Visionary,"
the hero of which is essentially the Finnish half
of himself, "all natural phenomena are intense,
and appear in colossal contrasts. There is an endless,
stony-gray desert as in primeval times, before
men dwelt there; but in the midst of this are also
endless natural riches. There is sun and glory of
summer, the day of which is not only twelve hours,
but lasts continuously, day and night, for three
months&mdash;a warm, bright, fragrance-laden summer,
with an infinite wealth of color and changing
beauty. Distances of seventy to eighty miles
across the mirror of the sea approach, as it were,
within earshot. The mountains clothe themselves
up to the very top with greenish-brown grass, and
in the glens and ravines the little birches join
hands for play, like white, sixteen-year-old girls;
while the fragrance of the strawberry and raspberry
fills the air as nowhere else; and the day is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
so hot that you feel a need to bathe yourself in
the sun-steeped, plashing sea, so wondrously clear
to the very bottom.... Myriads of birds are
surging through the air, like white breakers about
the cliffs, and like a screaming snow-storm about
their brooding-places...."</p>

<p>But "as a contrast there is a night of darkness
and terror which lasts nine months."</p>

<p>In this arctic gloom, during which the yellow
candle-light struggled all day long through the
frost-covered window-panes, the Finn grew big in
Jonas Lie, and the Norseman shrank and was almost
dwarfed. The air was teeming with superstitions
which he could not help imbibing. His fancy
fed eagerly on stories of Draugen, the terrible sea-bogie
who yells heartrendingly in the storm, and
the sight of whom means death; on blood-curdling
tales of Finnish sorcery and all sorts of uncanny
mysteries; on folk-legends of trolds, nixies, and
foul-weather sprites. He had his full share of that
craving for horrors which is common to boyhood;
and he had also the most exceptional facilities for
satisfying it. Truth to tell, if it had not been for
the Norse Jekyll in his nature the Finnish Hyde
might have run away with him altogether. They
were mighty queer things which often invaded his
brain, taking possession of his thought, paralyzing
his will, and refusing to budge, no matter how
earnestly he pleaded. There were times when he
grew afraid of himself; when his imagination got
the upper hand, blowing him hither and thither<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
like a weather-cock. Then the Norse Jekyll came
to his rescue and routed his uncomfortable yoke-fellow.
Hence that very curious phenomenon that
the same man who has given us sternly and soberly
realistic novels like "The Family at Gilje" and
"The Commodore's Daughters," is also the author
of the collection of tales called "Trold," in which
his fancy runs riot in a phantasmagoria of the
grotesquest imaginings. The same Jonas Lie who
comports himself so properly in the parlor is quite
capable, it appears, of joining nocturnally the
witches' dance at the Brocken and cutting up the
wildest antics under the pale glimpses of the moon.</p>

<p>Throughout his boyhood he struggled rather ineffectually
against his Hyde, who made him kill
roosters, buy cakes on credit, go on forbidden expeditions
by land and sea, and shamefully neglect
his lessons. Accordingly, he made an early acquaintance
with the rod, and was regarded as well-nigh
incorrigible. He accepted with boyish stoicism
the castigations which fell pretty regularly to
his lot, bore no one any grudge for them, but rarely
thought of mending his ways, in order to avoid
them. They were somehow part of the established
order of things which it was useless to criticise.
In his reminiscences from his early years, which he
published some years ago, he is so delightfully boy,
that no one who has any recollection of that barbaric
period in his own life can withhold his sympathy.
The following, for instance, seems to me
charming:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p>"I can still feel how she (Kvaen Marja, the
maid) pulled us, cowering and reluctant, out of
our warm beds, where we lay snug like birds in
their nests, between the reindeer skin and the
sheepskin covering. I remember how I stood
asleep and tottering on the floor, until I got a
shower of cold water from the bathing-sponge over
my back and became wide awake. Then to jump
into our clothes! And now for the lessons! It
was a problem how to get a peep at them during
the scant quarter hour, while the breakfast was
being devoured down in the dining-room with
mother, who sat and poured out tea before the big
astral lamp, while darkness and snow-drift lay
black upon the window-panes. Then up and
away!...</p>

<p>"There (in the school) I sat and perspired in
the sultry heat of the stove, and with a studiously
unconcerned face watched with strained anxiety
every expression and gesture of the teacher. Was
he in good-humor to-day? Would that I might
escape reciting! He began at the top....
That was a perfect millstone lifted from my
breast, though, as yet, nothing could be sure.
Now for a surreptitious peep at the end of the
lesson."</p>

<p>It was Jonas Lie's ambition at that time to become
a gunsmith. He had a profound respect for
the ingenuity and skill required for such a curious
bit of mechanism. But his father, who could not
afford to have a member of his family descend<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
into the rank of artisans, promptly strangled that
ambition. Then the sea, which has been "the
Norseman's path to praise and power," no less than
the Dane's, lured the adventurous lad; and his
parent, who had no exalted expectations regarding
him, gave his consent to his entering the Naval
Academy at Fredericksvaern. But here he was
rejected on account of near-sightedness. Nothing
remained, then, but to resume the odious books
and prepare to enter the University. But to a boy
whose heroes were the two master-thieves, Ola
H&ouml;iland and Gjest Baardsen, that must have been a
terribly arduous necessity. However, he submitted
with bad grace, and was enrolled as a pupil at the
gymnasium in Bergen. Here his Finnish Hyde
promptly got him into trouble. Having by sheer
ill luck been cheated of his chances of a heroic
career, he began to imagine in detail the potentialities
of greatness for the loss of which Fate owed
him reparation. And so absorbed did he become
in this game of fancy, and so enamored was he of
his own imaginary deeds, that he lost sight of the
fact that they were of the stuff that dreams are
made of. With frank and innocent trustfulness he
told them to his friends, both young and old, and
soon earned a reputation as a most unblushing
liar. But if any one dared call him that to his
face, he had to reckon with an awe-inspiring pair
of fists which were wielded with equal precision
and force. The youth, being at variance with the
world, lived in a state of intermittent warfare,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
and he gave and received valiant blows, upon
which he yet looks back with satisfaction.</p>

<p>In spite of his distaste for books Jonas Lie
managed, when he was eighteen years old, to pass
the entrance examination to the University.
Among his schoolmates during his last year of
preparation at Heltberg's Gymnasium, in Christiania,
were Bj&ouml;rnstjerne Bj&ouml;rnson and Henrik
Ibsen. The former took a great interest in the
odd, <i>na&iuml;ve</i>, near-sighted Nordlander who walked
his own ways, thought his own thoughts, and accepted
ridicule with crushing indifference.</p>

<p>"I was going about there in Christiania," he
says in a published letter to Bj&ouml;rnson, "as a young
student, undeveloped, dim, and unclear&mdash;a kind
of poetic visionary, a Nordland twilight nature&mdash;which
after a fashion espied what was abroad in
the age, but indistinctly in the dusk, as through a
water telescope&mdash;when I met a young, clear, full-born
force, pregnant with the nation's new day,
the blue steel-flash of determination in his eyes
and the happily found national form&mdash;pugnacious
to the very point of his pen. I gazed and stared,
fascinated, and took this new thing aboard along
the whole gunwale. Here, I felt, were definite
forms, no mere dusk and fantastic haze&mdash;something
to fashion into poetry.... From the
first hour you knew how to look straight into this
strange twilight of mine, and you espied flashes of
the aurora there when no one else did, like the
true and faithful friend you are. You helped and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
guided and found grains of gold, where others saw
mostly nonsense, and perhaps half a screw loose.
While I was straying in search of the spiritual tinsel,
with which the <i>esprits forts</i> of the age were
glittering, you taught me, and impressed upon me,
again and again, that I had to seek in myself for
whatever I might possess of sentiment and simplicity&mdash;and
that it was out of this I would have
to build my fiction."</p>

<p>This bit of confession is extremely significant.
The Finnish Hyde was evidently yet uppermost.
Bj&ouml;rnson taught Lie to distrust the tinsel glitter
of mere rhetoric, and the fantastic exuberance of
invention in which the young Nordlander believed
that he had his <i>forte</i>. But the matter had even a
more serious phase than this. It was about this
time that Lie disappeared for a period of three
months from his friends, and even his parents, and
when again he emerged into the daylight, he could
give no account of himself. He had simply sauntered
about, moping and dreaming. He had been
Hyde. The cold shudders which lurked in his
blood from the long, legend-haunted arctic night
could break into open terror on unforeseen occasions.
Grown man though he was, he was afraid
of being alone in the dark&mdash;a peculiarity which
once got him into a comical predicament.</p>

<p>It was his habit when travelling to place his big
top-boots at night within easy reach, so that he
might use them as weapons against any ghost or
suspicious-looking object that might be stirring in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
the gloom. One evening when he had gone to bed
at a country inn, he was aroused from his sleep
and saw indistinctly a white phenomenon fluttering
to and fro along the opposite wall. Instantly
he grabs a boot and hurls it with ferocious force at
the goblin. A roar was heard followed by a salvo
of blue profanity. It was a fellow-traveller&mdash;a
lumber-dealer&mdash;who was to occupy the other bed
in the room. He had undressed and was disporting
himself in nocturnal attire before reposing,
when Jonas Lie's well-aimed missile hit him in the
stomach and doubled him up with pain.</p>

<p>A skeleton in the den of a medical friend caused
Lie many a shiver, for he could never quite rid
himself of the idea that it moved. All that lay
beyond the range of the senses drew him with an
irresistible, half-shuddering attraction; and he
resented all attempts to explain it by ordinary
mundane laws. As his first novel abundantly
proves, he possesses in a marked degree the "sixth
sense" that gropes eagerly and with a half-terrified
fascination in the dusk that lies beyond the daylight
of the other five.</p>

<p>The verses which Jonas Lie began about this
time to produce are mostly written for patriotic
and other festive occasions, and therefore arouse
no creepy sensations. But they are so overladen
with confusing imagery that they have to be read
twice to be understood. In the poem "Solveig"
(1855) he makes the heart "in its prison envy the
free-born thoughts which fly to the beloved one's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
breast." His versification is gnarled and twisted,
and a perpetual strain upon the ear. As Mr. Nordahl
Rolfsen has remarked, one need not be a
princess in order to be troubled by the peas in his
verse.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Browning himself could scarcely have
perpetrated more unmelodious lines than Jonas
Lie is capable of. Nevertheless there is often in
his patriotic songs a most inspiriting bugle-note,
which is found nowhere in Browning, unless it be
in the "Cavalier Tunes." The curiosities of his
prosody are (according to his biographer) attributable
to the Nordland accent in his speech. They
would sound all right, he says, to a Nordland ear.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_13_13" id="Footnote_13_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> Nordahl Rolfsen: Norske Digtere, p. 527.</p></div>

<p>At the risk of violating chronology I may as
well speak here of his two collections of "Poems"
(1867 and 1889) (the latter being an expurgated but
enlarged edition of the earlier), to which the present
criticisms particularly apply. Both editions
contain notable things amid occasional bits of what
scarcely rises above doggerel. The sailor songs,
though rough, are true in tone and have a catching
nautical swing; but of far deeper ring and
more intensely felt are the poems which deal with
the nocturnal sides of nature. These have at
times a strange, shivering resonance, like an old
violin whose notes ripple down your spine. I refer
especially to such untranslatable poems as
"Draugen," "Finn-Shot," "The Mermaid," and
"Nightmare." The mood of these is heavy and
uncanny, like that of the "Ancient Mariner."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
But they are indubitably poetry. It is by no
means sure that the world has not lost a poet in
Jonas Lie; but probably a lesser one than the
novelist that it gained.</p>

<p>As Jonas had been voted by his kin the family
dullard, it was decided to make a clergyman of
him. But to this the young man objected, chiefly,
according to his own story, because the clerical
gown looks too much like a petticoat. At all
events, after having equipped himself with a set
of theological tomes, and peeped cursorily into
them, he grew so discouraged that he went to the
bookseller and exchanged them for a set of law-books.
Not that the law had any peculiar attraction
for him; he rather accepted it as a <i>pis aller</i>;
for, of course, he had to study something. In due
time he was graduated, but with such poor standing
that he concluded to put in another year and
try again. And this time he managed to acquit
himself creditably. He then began (1859) the
practice of the law in the little town of Kongsvinger,
the centre of the richest lumber districts in
Norway. But in the meanwhile he had had an
experience of another kind which is worth recounting.</p>

<p>From his boyhood he had been a worshipper of
the fair sex. Marriages (of other people) had been
among the most tragic events in his life; and he
rarely failed to shed tears at the thought that now
this lovely charmer, too, was removed from the
number of his possible selections. If things went<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
on in this way he would have no choice but to be
a bachelor. However, one fine day a most attractive-looking
craft, bearing the name Thomasine
Lie, appeared upon his horizon, sailed within
speaking distance, and presently a great deal nearer.
In fact, though they were cousins, it took a
remarkably short time for the two young people to
discover that they loved each other; and when
that discovery was made, they acted upon it with
laudable promptitude. They became engaged; and
were subsequently married. And from that day
the Finnish Hyde in Jonas was downed and reduced
to permanent subjection. He never raised
his head again. The more sober-minded, industrious,
and sensible Norse Jekyll took command and
steered with a steady hand, in fair weather and
foul, and often through dangerous waters, the
barque Jonas Lie, which came to carry more and
more passengers the longer it proceeded on its
voyage.</p>

<p>Truth to tell, I know among contemporary men
of letters no more complete, happy, and altogether
beautiful marriage than that of Jonas and Thomasine
Lie. The nearest parallel to it that I can
think of is that of John Stuart Mill and Mrs. Taylor,
who later became Mrs. Mill.</p>

<p>Lie's friends accuse him of carrying his admiration
of his wife to the verge of idolatry. He will
leave himself but little merit, but with an air of
candid conviction he attributes even his authorship
to his Thomasine. "Her name ought to stand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
next to mine on the title-pages of my books," he
has repeatedly declared. And again, "If I have
written anything that is good, then my wife deserves
as much credit for it as myself ...
Without her nothing would have come of it except
nonsense."</p>

<p>Even though that may be an exaggeration, pure
delusion it is not. For Mrs. Lie is, in a certain
way, the complement to her husband. She possesses
what he has not; and he possesses what she,
in her modest self-extinction, would never dream
of laying claim to. The spirit of order, adjustment,
and lucidity is strong in her; while he, in his
fanciful exuberance, is often overwhelmed by his
material, and is unable to get it into shape. Then
she quietly steps in and separates the dry land from
the water in his seething and struggling chaos.
She is one of those rare women who, while apparently
only listening, can give you back your own
thoughts clarified. Mr. Garborg relates most
charmingly how she straightens out the tangles in
her husband's plots, and unobtrusively draws him
back, when, as frequently happens, he has switched
himself off on a side-line and is unable to recover
his bearings. And this occurs as often in his conversation
as in his manuscripts, which he never
despatches to the publisher without her revision.
She helps him condense. She knows just what to
omit. Yet she does not pretend to be in the least
literary. Her proper department, in which she is
also a shining success, is the care of her children<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
and the superintendence of her household. She
understands to perfection the art of economy and
has a keen practical sense, which makes her admirably
competent in all the more difficult situations
in life. And he, feeling her competence and
his own deficiency, frankly leans on her. Hence a
certain motherliness on her part (most beautiful to
behold) has tinged their relation; and on his an
admiring and affectionate dependence. Each prizes
in the other what he himself lacks; and the husband's
genius loses none of its brightness to the
wife, because it is herself who trims the wick and
adjusts the reflectors which send its light abroad.</p>

<p>I have again anticipated, because the subsequent
career of Jonas Lie could not be properly understood
without a full appreciation of the new factor
which from this time enters into it. He developed
signal ability as a lawyer during the years of his
practice at Kongsvinger; became prosperous and
influential, bought a considerable estate (called
Sigridnaes) and began to dabble in politics. He
still wrote occasional poems, and was the soul of
all conviviality in the town. He entertained celebrities,
wrote political leaders in the papers, earned
a great deal of money, lived high, and unfolded a
restless and widely ramified activity. Then came
the great financial crisis of 1867-68, which swept
away so many great fortunes in Norway. Lie became
involved (chiefly by endorsement of commercial
paper) to the extent of several hundred thousand
dollars. He gave up everything he had, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
moved to Christiania, resolved to pay the enormous
debt, for which he had incurred legal responsibility,
to the last farthing. Quixotic as it may
seem, it was his intention to accomplish this by
novel-writing. And to his honor be it said that
for a long series of years he kept sending every
penny he could spare, above the barest necessities,
to his creditors, refusing to avail himself of the
bankruptcy law and accept a compromise. But it
was a bottomless pit into which he was throwing
his hard-earned pennies, and in the end he had to
yield to the persuasions of his family and abandon
the hopeless enterprise.</p>

<p>In Christiania he spent some hard and penurious
years, trying to make a livelihood as a journalist
and man of letters. Some of his friends
suspected that the Lie family were subsisting on
very short rations; but they were proud, and
there was no way to help them. The ex-lawyer
developed ultra-democratic sympathies, and time
and again his Thomasine led the dance at the balls
of the Laborers' Union with Mr. Eilert Sundt.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
A position as teacher of Norwegian in Heltberg's
Gymnasium he lost because he only made orations
to his pupils, but taught them no rhetoric. His
volume of "Poems" (1867) had attracted no particular
attention; but his political articles were
much read and discussed. However, it was not in
politics that he was to win his laurels.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_14_14" id="Footnote_14_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14_14"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> A well-known Norwegian philanthropist, whose work on the

<p>A little before Christmas, 1870, there appeared
from Gyldendal's publishing-house in Copenhagen
a novel, entitled "The Visionary" (<i>Den Fremsynte</i>),
by Jonas Lie. To analyze the impression
which this strange book makes at the first reading
is difficult. I thought, as I sat rejoicing in
its vivid light and color, twenty-four years ago:
"This Jonas Lie is a sort of century-plant, and
'The Visionary' is his one blossom. It is the one
good novel which almost every life is said to contain.
Only this is so strikingly good that it is a
pity it will have no successors."</p>

<p>It was evidently himself, or rather the Finnish
part of himself, the author was exploring; it
was in the mine of his own experience he was
delving; it was his own heart he was coining.
That may, in a sense, be true of every book of
any consequence; but it was most emphatically
true of "The Visionary." It is not to the use of
the first person that this autobiographical note is
primarily due; but to a certain beautiful intimacy
in the narrative, and a <i>na&iuml;ve</i> confidence which
charms the reader and takes him captive. With a
lavish hand Lie has drawn upon the memories of
his boyhood in the arctic North; and it was the
newness of the nature which he revealed, no less
than the picturesque force of his language, which
contributed in no small degree to the success of
his book. But, above all, it was the sweetness
and pathos of the exquisite love story. Susanna,
though as to talents not much above the commonplace,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
is ravishing. To have breathed the breath
of such warm and living life into a character of
fiction is no small achievement. It is the loveliness
of love, the sweetness of womanhood, the glorious
ferment of the blood in the human springtide
which are celebrated in "The Visionary."
The thing is beautifully done. I do not know
where young love has been more touchingly portrayed,
unless it be in some of the Russian tales of
Tourgu&eacute;neff.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> The second-sight with which the
hero, David Holst, is afflicted, introduces an undertone
of sadness&mdash;a pensive minor key&mdash;and
seems to necessitate the tragic <i>d&eacute;nouement</i>.</p>

<p>The immediate success of "The Visionary"
changed Jonas Lie's situation and prospects. He
was first sent with a public stipend to Nordland
for the purpose of studying the character, manners,
and economic condition of the dwellers within
the polar zone; and, like the conscientious man he
is, he made an exhaustive report to the proper
department, detailing with touching minuteness
the results of his observations. The Norwegian
government has always taken a strong (and usually
very intelligent) interest in rising artists, musicians,
and men of letters, and has endeavored by
stipends and salaries to compensate them for the
smallness of the public which the country affords.
Jonas Lie was now a sufficiently conspicuous man
to come into consideration in the distribution of
the official <i>panem et circenses</i>. The state awarded<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
him a largess of $400 for one year (twice renewed),
in order to enable him to go to Italy and "educate
himself for a poet;" and he was also made a
beneficiary of the well-known Schafer legacy for
the training of artists. In the autumn of 1871 he
started with his wife and four children for Rome.
It was in a solemnly festal frame of mind that he
now resolved to devote the rest of his life to his
real vocation, which at last he had found. This
was what they had all meant&mdash;his gropings, trials,
and failures. They had all fitted him for the life-work
which was now to be his. The world lay
before him as in the shining calm after storm.</p>

<p>He took his artistic training, as everything else,
with extreme seriousness. With the utmost conscientiousness
he started out with his Thomasine,
morning after morning, to study the Vatican and
the Capitoline collections. "Happy is the man,"
says Goethe, "who learns early in life what art
means." But Jonas Lie was thirty-eight years
old; and, as far as I can judge from his writings,
I should venture to say that the secret of classical
art has never been unlocked to him. It lies probably
rather remote from the sphere of his sensations.
His genius is so profoundly Germanic that
only an ill-wisher would covet for him that expansion
of vision which would enable him to perceive
with any degree of artistic realization and intimacy
the glorious serenity of the Juno Ludovisi and the
divine distinction of the Apollo Belvedere.</p>

<p>The two books which were the first-fruits of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
the Roman sojourn were a disappointment to his
friends, though in the case of the unpretentious
collection called "Tales and Sketches from Nordland"
(1872) there is no reason why it should
have been. The public found that it was not on
a level with "The Visionary," and by "The Visionary"
Jonas Lie was bound to be judged,
whether he liked it or not. That is the penalty
of having produced a masterpiece, that one is
never permitted to follow the example of <i>bonus
Homerus</i>, who, as every one knows, sometimes
nods. Jonas Lie was far from nodding in "The
Barque Future" (1872). There was an abundance
of interest in the material, and a delightful
picturesque vigor in the descriptions of nature.
But of romantic interest of the kind which the
ordinary novel-reader craves, there was very little.
<i>&Agrave; propos</i> of "The Barque Future" let me quote a
bit of general characterization which applies to
nearly all the subsequent works of Jonas Lie.</p>

<p>"It is in this particular that Jonas Lie most
distinctly diverges from all romanticism and romance-writing:
His interest in practical affairs,
his ability to see poetry in that which is contemporary.
The sawdust in the rivers has never
offended him, nor the Briton's black cloud of coal-smoke.
The busy toil of office and shop is not
prose to him. He penetrates to the bottom of its
meaning&mdash;its significance to civilization."<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_16_16" id="Footnote_16_16"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16_16"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> Arne Garborg: Jonas Lie, p. 172.</p></div>

<p>"The Barque Future" is, as regards its problem,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
Gustav Freytag's <i>Soll und Haben</i> ("Debit
and Credit") transferred to Nordland. Instead
of the noble house of Rothsattel we have the
ancient and highly esteemed commercial firm of
Heggelund, whose chief falls into the toils of the
scoundrel, Stuwitz, very much as Baron Rothsattel
was dragged to ruin by the Jew Veitel Itzig.
But no more than Freytag can find it in his heart
to award the victory to the Hebrew usurer, can
Lie violate the proprieties of fiction by permitting
Stuwitz to fatten on his spoil. He could not, like
the German novelist, conjure up a noble gentleman
of democratic sympathies and practical ability
(like von Finck) and make him emerge in the
nick of time as the heir of the ancient gentry,
justifying the dignities which he enjoys in the
state by the uses which he fulfils. In Norway
there is no nobility; and Lie, therefore, had to
make his able and industrious plebeian, Morten
Jonsen (the equivalent of Anton Wohlfahrt in
<i>Soll und Haben</i>) the inheritor of the future. He
accordingly awards to him the hand of Miss Edele
Heggelund; but not until he has put Jacob to
shame by the amount and character of the work by
which he earns his Rachel.</p>

<p>The reception of "The Barque Future" was
far from satisfactory to its author. He grew apprehensive
about himself. He could not afford
another failure; nay, not even a <i>succ&egrave;s d'estime</i>.
Accordingly he waited two years, and published in
1874 "The Pilot and his Wife," which made its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
mark. It is an every-day story in the best sense
of the word, the history of a marriage among common
folk. And yet so true is it, so permeated
with a warm and rich humanity, that it holds the
reader's attention from beginning to end. Then,
to add to its interest, it has some bearing upon the
woman question. Lie maintains that no true marriage
can exist where the wife sacrifices her personality,
and submits without a protest to neglect
and ill-treatment. Happily we are not particularly
in need of that admonition on our side of the
ocean. The wife of the pilot, Salve Christensen,
had once broken her engagement with him, having
become enamored of the handsome naval lieutenant,
Beck; but she recovers her senses and marries
Christensen, whom she really loves. After her
marriage she tries to do penance for the wrong she
has done him by being, as she fancies, a model
wife. But by submission and self-extinction, so
alien to her character, she arouses his suspicion
that she has something on her conscience; and, in
his feeling of outrage, he begins to neglect and
abuse her. When, at last, his maltreatment
reaches a climax, she arises in all the dignity of
her womanhood, and asserts her true self. Then
comes reconciliation, followed by a united life of
true equality and loving comradeship.</p>

<p>Such a mere skeleton of a plot can, of course,
give no conception of the wealth of vivid details
with which the book abounds. There is, however,
a certain air of effort about it, of a strenuous seriousness,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
which is, I fancy, the temperamental
note of this author.</p>

<p>"The Pilot and his Wife" besides reviving Lie's
popularity also served to define his position in
Norwegian literature. He had at first been assigned
a definite corner as the "poet of Nordland,"
but his ambition was not satisfied with so narrow a
province. In all his tales, so far, he has surpassed
all predecessors in his descriptions of the sea; and
the critics, when favorably disposed, fell into the
habit of referring to him as "the novelist of the
sea," "the poet of the ocean," etc. The Norwegian
sailor, whom he may be said to have revealed
in "The Pilot," came to be considered more and
more as his property; and no one can read such
tales as "Press On" (<i>Gaa Paa</i>) and "Rutland"
without agreeing that the title is well merited. I
know of no English novelist since Smollett, who
produces so deep a sense of reality in his descriptions
of maritime life. Mr. Clark Russell, who
knows his ship from masthead to keel as thoroughly
as Jonas Lie, and writes fully as clever a
story, seems to me to have a lower aim, in so
far as the novel of adventure, <i>c&aelig;teris paribus</i>,
belongs on a lower level than the novel of character.</p>

<p>In the year 1874 the Norwegian Storthing conferred
upon Jonas Lie an annual "poet's salary"
of about six hundred dollars. This is supposed to
supply a warranty deed to a lot on Parnassus. It
removes any possible flaw in the title to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
immortality. Lie was now lifted into the illustrious triumvirate
in which Bj&ouml;rnson and Ibsen were his predecessors.
Great expectations were entertained of
his literary future. But, oddly enough, this official
recognition did not have a favorable effect upon
Lie. He felt himself almost oppressed by a sense
of obligation to yield full returns for what he consumed
of the public revenues. In 1875 he published
a versified tale, "Faustina Strozzi," dealing
with the struggle for Italian liberty. In spite of
many excellences it fell rather flat, and was
roughly handled by the critics. Even a worse
fate befell its successor, "Thomas Ross" (1878),
a novel of contemporary life in the Norwegian
capital. It is a pale, and rather labored story, in
which a young girl, of the Rosamond Vincy type,
is held up to scorn, and the atrocity of flirtation
is demonstrated by the most tragic consequences.
There is likewise an air of triviality about "Adam
Schrader" (1879); and Lie became seriously alarmed
about himself when he had to register a third failure.
Like its predecessor, this book is full of
keen observations, and the sketches of the social
futilities and the typical characters at a summer
watering-place are surely good enough to pass
muster. But, somehow, the material fails to combine
into a sufficiently coherent and impressive
picture; and the total effect remains rather feeble.
In a drama, "Grabow's Cat" (1880), he suffered
shipwreck once more, though he saved something
from the waves. The play was performed in Christiania<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
and Stockholm, and aroused interest, but
not enough to keep it afloat.</p>

<p>It has been said of Browning that he succeeded
by a series of failures, which meant, in his case,
that his books failed to command instant attention,
but were gradually discovered by the thoughtful
few who by their appreciation spread the poet's
fame among the thoughtless many. It was not in
this way that Jonas Lie's failures conduced to his
final success. "Thomas Ross," "Adam Schrader,"
and "Grabow's Cat" have not grown perceptibly
in the estimation either of the critics or of the
public since their first appearance. But they supplied
their author a hard but needed discipline.
They warned him against over-confidence and
routine work. He had passed through a soul-trying
experience, in its effect not unlike the one
which Keats describes <i>&agrave; propos</i> of "Endymion:"</p>

<p>"In 'Endymion' I leaped headlong into the sea
and thereby have become better acquainted with
the soundings, the quicksands, and the rocks than
if I had stayed upon the green shore, took tea and
comfortable advice. I was never afraid of failure&mdash;would
rather fail than not be among the greatest."</p>

<p>Jonas Lie reconquered at one stroke all that he
had lost, by the delightful sea-novel "Rutland"
(1881), and reinstated himself still more securely
in the hearts of an admiring public by the breezy
tale, "Press On" (1882). But after so protracted
a sea-voyage he began to long for the shore, where,
up to date he had suffered all his reverses. It could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
not be that he who had lived all his life on <i>terra
firma</i>, and was so profoundly interested in the problems
of modern society, should be banished forever,
like "The Man Without a Country," to the briny
deep, and be debarred from describing the things
which he had most at heart. One more attempt he
was bound to make, even at the risk of another failure.
Accordingly in 1883 appeared "The Life
Prisoner" (<i>Livsslaven</i>), which deserved a better fate
than befell it. The critics found it depressing, compared
it to Zola, and at the same time scolded the
author because he lacked indignation and neglected
to denounce the terrible conditions which
he described. He replied to their arraignments in
an angry but very effective letter. But that did
not save the book. Truth to tell, "The Life
Prisoner" is a dismal tale. It was, in fact, the
irruption of modern naturalism into Norwegian
literature. It reminds one in its tone more of
Dostoyevski's "Crime and Punishment" than of
"L'Assommoir." For to my mind Dostoyevski is
a greater exponent of naturalism than Zola, whom
Lemaitre not inaptly styles "an epic poet." The
pleasing and well-bred truths or lies, to the expounding
of which <i>belles lettres</i> had hitherto been
confined, were here discarded or ignored. The
author had taken a plunge into the great dumb
deep of the nethermost social strata, which he has
explored with admirable conscientiousness and artistic
perception. Few men of letters would object
to being the father of so creditable a failure.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
Lie, being convinced that his book was a good one,
no matter what the wielders of critical tomahawks
might say to the contrary, resolved to persevere in
the line he had chosen and to pluck victory from
the heels of defeat. And the victory came even the
same year (1883), when he published what, to my
mind, is the most charming of all his novels, "The
Family at Gilje." That is a book which is taken,
warm and quivering, out of the very heart of Norway.
The humor which had been cropping out
tentatively in Lie's earlier tales comes here to its
full right, and his shy, beautiful pathos gleams
like hidden tears behind his genial smile. It is
close wrought cloth of gold. No loosely woven
spots&mdash;no shoddy woof of cheaper material. Captain
Jaeger and his wife, Inger-Johanna, J&ouml;rgen,
Grip, nay, the whole company of sober, everyday
mortals that come trooping through its chapters
are so delightfully human that you feel the blood
pulse under their skin at the first touch. It is a
triumph indeed, to have written a book like "The
Family at Gilje."</p>

<p>From this time forth Jonas Lie's career presents
an unbroken series of successes. "A Maelstrom"
(1884), "Eight Stories," "Married Life" (<i>Et
Samliv</i>), (1887), "Maisa Jons" (1888), "The
Commodore's Daughters" and "Evil Powers"
(1890), which deal with interesting phases of contemporary
life, are all extremely modern in feeling
and show the same effort to discard all tinsel and
sham and get at the very heart of reality.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span></p>

<p>He had by this series of novels established his
reputation as a relentless realist, when, in 1892, he
surprised his admirers by the publication of two
volumes of the most wildly fantastic tales, entitled
"Trold." It was as if a volcano, with writhing
torrents of flame and smoke, had burst forth from
under a sidewalk in Broadway. It was the suppressed
Finn who, for once, was going to have his
fling, even though he were doomed henceforth to
silence. It was the "queer thoughts" (which
had accumulated in the author and which he had
scrupulously imprisoned) returning to take vengeance
upon him unless he released them. The
most grotesque, weird, and uncanny imaginings
(such as Stevenson would delight in) are crowded
together in these tales, some of which are derived
from folk-lore and legends, while others are free
fantasies.</p>

<p>Before taking leave of Jonas Lie, a word about
his style is in order. Style, as such, counts for
very little with him. Yet he has a distinctly individual
and vigorous manner of utterance, though
a trifle rough, perhaps, abrupt, elliptic, and conversational.
Mere decorative adjectives and clever
felicities of phrase he scorns. All scientific and
social phenomena&mdash;all that we include under the
term modern progress&mdash;command his most intense
and absorbed attention. Having since 1882 been
a resident of Paris (except during his annual summer
excursions to Norway or the mountains of
Bavaria) he has had the advantage of seeing the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
society which he describes at that distance which,
if it does not lend enchantment, at all events unifies
the scattered impressions, and furnishes a convenient
critical outpost. He does not permit himself,
however, like so many foreigners in the
French capital, to lapse into that supercilious cosmopolitanism
which deprives a man of his own
country without giving him any other in exchange.
No; Jonas Lie is and remains a Norseman&mdash;a
fact which he demonstrated (to the gratification
of his countrymen) on a recent occasion.
At the funeral of the late Professor O. J. Broch&mdash;a
famous Norwegian who died in Paris&mdash;the chaplain
of the Swedish legation made an oration in
which he praised the departed statesman and scientist,
referring to him constantly as "our countryman."
When he had finished, Jonas Lie, without
anybody's invitation, stepped quietly up to the
coffin and in the name of Norway bade <i>his</i> countryman
a last farewell. "The spirit came over
Lie," says his biographer, "and he spoke with ravishing
eloquence."</p>

<p>But why did he do such an uncalled-for thing,
you will ask? Because there is a systematic effort
on the part of Sweden to suppress the very name
of Norway, and to give the impression, throughout
the world, that there is no such nationality as the
Norwegian. Therefore every Norseman (unless
he chooses to be a party to this suppression) is obliged
to assert his nationality in season and out of
season. But Jonas Lie has, indeed, in a far more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
effective way borne aloft the banner of his country.
His books have been translated into French,
German, English, Dutch, Swedish, Finnish, Italian,
Russian, and Bohemian; and throughout
Europe the literary journals and magazines are

<h2>HANS CHRISTIAN ANDERSEN<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></h2>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_17_17" id="Footnote_17_17"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17_17"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> A portion of this essay appeared originally in "The Dial"
of Chicago.</p></div>


<p>Hans Christian Andersen was a
unique figure in Danish literature, and a
solitary phenomenon in the literature of the world.
Superficial critics have compared him with the
Brothers Grimm; they might with equal propriety
have compared him with Voltaire or with the man
in the moon. Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm were
scientific collectors of folk-lore, and rendered as
faithfully as possible the simple language of the
peasants from whose lips they gathered their
stories. It was the ethnological and philological
value of the fairy-tale which stimulated their zeal;
its poetic value was of quite secondary significance.
With Andersen the case was exactly the reverse.
He was as innocent of scientific intention as the
hen who finds a diamond on a dunghill is of mineralogy.
It was the poetic phase alone of the fairy-tale
which attracted him; and what is more, he
saw poetic possibilities where no one before him
had ever discovered them. By the alchemy of
genius (which seems so perfectly simple until you
try it yourself) he transformed the common neglected
nonsense of the nursery into rare poetic
treasure. Boots, who kills the ogre and marries<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
the princess&mdash;the typical lover in fiction from the
remotest Aryan antiquity down to the present
time&mdash;appears in Andersen in a hundred disguises,
not with the rudimentary features of the old story,
but modernized, individualized, and carrying on
his shield an unobtrusive little moral. In "Jack
the Dullard" he comes nearest to his primitive
prototype, and no visible effort is made to refine
him. In "The Most Extraordinary Thing" he is
the vehicle of a piece of social satire, and narrowly
escapes the lot which the Fates seem especially to
have prepared for inventors, viz., to make the
fortune of some unscrupulous clown while they
themselves die in poverty. In "The Porter's
Son" he is an aspiring artist, full of the fire of
genius, and he wins his princess by conquering
that many-headed ogre with which every self-made
man has to battle&mdash;the world's envy, and malice,
and contempt for a lowly origin. It is easy to multiply
examples, but these may suffice.</p>

<p>In another species of fairy-tale, which Andersen
may be said to have invented, incident seems to be
secondary to the moral purpose, which is yet so artfully
hidden that it requires a certain maturity of
intellect to detect it. In this field Andersen has
done his noblest work and earned his immortality.
Who can read that marvellous little tale, "The
Ugly Duckling," without perceiving that it is a
subtle, most exquisite revenge the poet is taking
upon the humdrum Philistine world, which despised
and humiliated him, before he lifted his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>
wings and flew away with the swans, who knew
him as their brother? And yet, as a child, I remember
reading this tale with ever fresh delight,
though I never for a moment suspected its moral.
The hens and the ducks and the geese were all so
vividly individualized, and the incidents were so
familiar to my own experience, that I demanded
nothing more for my entertainment. Likewise in
"The Goloshes of Fortune" there is a wealth of
amusing adventures, all within the reach of a
child's comprehension, which more than suffices
to fascinate the reader who fails to penetrate beneath
the surface. The delightful satire, which is
especially applicable to Danish society, is undoubtedly
lost to nine out of ten of the author's foreign
readers, but so prodigal is he both of humorous
and pathetic meaning, that every one is charmed
with what he finds, without suspecting how much
he has missed. "The Little Mermaid" belongs
to the same order of stories, though the pathos
here predominates, and the resemblance to De la
Motte Fouqu&eacute;'s "Undine" is rather too striking.
But the gem of the whole collection, I am inclined
to think, is "The Emperor's New Clothes," which
in subtlety of intention and universality of application
rises above age and nationality. Respect for
the world's opinion and the tyranny of fashion
have never been satirized with more exquisite
humor than in the figure of the emperor who
walks through the streets of his capital in <i>robe de
nuit</i>, followed by a procession of courtiers, who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
all go into ecstasies over the splendor of his attire.</p>

<p>It was not only in the choice of his theme that
Andersen was original. He also created his style,
though he borrowed much of it from the nursery.
"It was perfectly wonderful," "You would scarcely
have believed it," "One would have supposed that
there was something the matter in the poultry-yard,
but there was nothing at all the matter"&mdash;such
beginnings are not what we expect to meet
in dignified literature. They lack the conventional
style and deportment. No one but Andersen
has ever dared to employ them. As Dr. Brandes
has said in his charming essay on Andersen, no
one has ever attempted, before him, to transfer
the vivid mimicry and gesticulation which accompany
a nursery tale to the printed page. If you
tell a child about a horse, you don't say that it
neighed, but you imitate the sound; and the
child's laughter or fascinated attention compensates
you for your loss of dignity. The more successfully
you crow, roar, grunt, and mew, the more
vividly you call up the image and demeanor of the
animal you wish to represent, and the more impressed
is your juvenile audience. Now, Andersen
does all these things in print: a truly wonderful
feat. Every variation in the pitch of the
voice&mdash;I am almost tempted to say every change of
expression in the story-teller's features&mdash;is contained
in the text. He does not write his story,
he tells it; and all the children of the whole wide<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
world sit about him and listen with, eager, wide-eyed
wonder to his marvellous improvisations.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_18_18" id="Footnote_18_18"></a><a href="#FNanchor_18_18"><span class="label">[18]</span></a> Brandes: Kritiker og Portraiter, p. 303.</p></div>

<p>In reading Andersen's collected works one is
particularly impressed with the fact that what he
did outside of his chosen field is of inferior quality&mdash;inferior,
I mean, judged by his own high standard,
though in itself often highly valuable and
interesting. "The Improvisatore," upon which,
next to "The Wonder-Tales," his fame rests, is a
kind of disguised autobiography which exhibits
the author's morbid sensibility and what I should
call the unmasculine character of his mind,<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> To
appeal to the reader's pity in your hero's behalf is
a daring experiment, and it cannot, except in brief
scenes, be successful. A prolonged strain of compassion
soon becomes wearisome, and not the
worthiest object in the world can keep one's charity
interested through four hundred pages. Antonio,
in "The Improvisatore," is a milksop whom
the author, with a lavish expenditure of sympathy,
parades as a hero. He is positively ludicrous
in his pitiful softness, vanity, and humility.
That the book nevertheless remains unfailingly
popular, and is even yet found in the satchel of
every Roman tourist, is chiefly due to the poetic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
intensity with which the author absorbed and portrayed
every Roman sight and sound. Italy throbs
and glows in the pages of "The Improvisatore"&mdash;the
old vagabond Italy of pre-Garibaldian days,
when priests and bandits and pretty women divided
the power of Church and State. Story's
"Roba di Roma," Augustus Hare's "Walks in
Rome," and all the other descriptions of the Eternal
City, are but disguised guide-books, feeble and
pale performances, when compared with Andersen's
beautiful romance.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_19_19" id="Footnote_19_19"></a><a href="#FNanchor_19_19"><span class="label">[19]</span></a> R. L. Stevenson in speaking of the "Character of Dogs"
makes the following cruel observation: "Hans Christian Andersen,
as we behold him in his startling memoirs, thrilling from top
to toe with an excruciating vanity and scouting even along the
streets for the shadows of offence&mdash;here was the talking dog."&mdash;Memories
and Portraits, p. 196.</p></div>

<p>The same feminine sentimentality which, in spite
of its picturesqueness, makes "The Improvisatore"
unpalatable to many readers, is still more glaringly
exhibited in "O. T." and "The Two Baronesses."
In "The Story of My Life" the same quality asserts
itself on every page in the most unpleasant
manner. The author makes no effort to excite the
reader's admiration, but he makes constant appeals
to his sympathy. Nevertheless this autobiography
rivals in historic and poetic worth Rousseau's
"Confessions" and Benvenuto Cellini's "Life."
The absolute candor with which Andersen lays
bare his soul, the complete intentional or unintentional
self-revelation, gives a psychological value to
the book which no mere literary graces could bestow.
I confess, until I had the pleasure of making
Andersen's acquaintance, "The Fairy Tale of
My Life" impressed me unpleasantly. After I
had by personal intercourse possessed myself of
the clew to the man's character, I judged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
differently. Andersen remained, until the day of his
death, a child. His innocence was more than virginal;
his unworldliness simply inconceivable. He
carried his heart on his sleeve, and invited you to
observe what a soft, tender, and sensitive heart it
was. He had the harmless vanity of a child who
has a new frock on. He was fidgety and unhappy
if anybody but himself was the centre of attraction;
and guilelessly happy when he could talk
and be admired and sympathized with. His conversation
was nearly always about himself, or about
the kings and princes and lofty personages who
had graciously deigned to take notice of him. He
was a tuft-hunter of a rare and curious sort; not
because he valued the glory reflected upon himself
by royal acquaintances, but because the pomp and
splendor of a court satisfied his thirst for the marvellous.
A king seemed to him, as to the boy who
reads his fairy-tales, something grand and remote;
and in invading this charmed sphere he seemed to
have invaded his own fairy-tales, and to live actually
in the fabulous region of wonders in which his
fancy revelled. He conceived of his life as a fairy-tale,
and delighted in living up to his own ideal of
living. The very title of his autobiography in
Danish (<i>Mit Livs Eventyr</i>) shows this conclusively;
and it ought to have been rendered in English
"The Fairy-Tale of My Life." "The Story of
My Life," as Mr. Scudder has translated it, would
have been in the original "Mit Livs Historie,"
a very common title, by the way, for an autobiography,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
while <i>Mit Livs Eventyr</i> is entirely
unique.</p>

<p>The feeling of the marvellous pervades the
book from beginning to end. The prose facts of
life had but a remote and indistinct existence to
the poet, and he blundered along miserably in his
youth, supported and upheld by a dim but unquenchable
aspiration. He commiserated himself,
and yet felt that there was something great in
store for him because of his exceptional endowment.
Every incident in his career he treated as
if it were a miracle, which required the suspension
of the laws of the universe for its performance.
God was a benevolent old man with a long beard
(just as he was depicted in old Dr. Luther's Catechism)
who sat up in the skies and spent his time
chiefly in managing the affairs of Hans Christian
Andersen as pleasantly as possible; and Hans
Christian was duly grateful, and cried on every
third or fourth page at the thought of the
goodness of God and man. Sometimes, for a
change, he cried at the wickedness of the latter,
and marvelled, with the <i>na&iuml;vet&eacute;</i> of a spoiled child,
that there should be such dreadful people in the
world, who should persist in misunderstanding
and misrepresenting him. Those who were good
to him he exalted and lauded to the skies, no matter
how they conducted themselves toward the rest
of humanity. Some of the most mediocre princes,
who had paid him compliments, he embalmed in
prose and verse. Frederick VII. of Denmark,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
whose immorality was notorious, was, according
to Andersen, "a good, amiable king," "sent by
God to Danish land and folk," than whom "no
truer man the Danish language spoke." And this
case was by no means exceptional. The same uncritical
partiality toward the great and mighty is
perceptible in every chapter of "The Fairy-Tale
of My Life." It was not, however, toward the
great and mighty alone that he assumed this attitude;
he was uncritical by nature, and had too
soft a heart to find fault with anybody&mdash;except
those who did not like his books. Heine's jocose
description of heaven as a place where he could
eat cakes and sweets, and drink punch <i>ad libitum</i>,
and where the angels sat around raving about his
poetry, was probably not so very remote from
Andersen's actual conception. His world was the
child's world, in which there is but one grand division
into good and bad, and the innumerable
host that occupies the middle-ground between
these poles is ignored. Those who praised what
he wrote were good people; those who ridiculed
him were a malignant and black-hearted lot whom
he was very sorry for and would include in his
prayers, in the hope that God might make them
better.</p>

<p>We may smile at this simple system; but we all
remember the time when we were addicted to a
similar classification. That it is a sign of immaturity
of intellect is undeniable; and in Andersen's
case it is one of the many indications that intellectually<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
he never outgrew his childhood. He
never possessed the power of judgment that we
expect in a grown-up man. His opinions on
social and political questions were <i>na&iuml;ve</i> and quite
worthless. And yet, in spite of all these limitations,
he was a poet of rare power; nay, I may say
in consequence of them. The vitality which in
other authors goes toward intellectual development,
produced in him strength and intensity of
imagination. Everything which his fancy touched
it invested with life and beauty. It divined the
secret soul of bird and beast and inanimate things.
His hens and ducks and donkeys speak as hens
and ducks and donkeys would speak if they could
speak. Their temperaments and characters are
scrupulously respected. Even shirt-collars, gingerbread
men, darning-needles, flowers, and sunbeams,
he endowed with physiognomies and
speech, fairly consistent with their ruling characteristics.
This personification, especially of inanimate
objects, may at first appear arbitrary;
but it is part of the beautiful consistency of Andersen's
genius that it never stoops to mere amusing
and fantastic trickery. The character of the
darning-needle is the character which a child
would naturally attribute to a darning-needle,
and the whole multitude of vivid personifications
which fills his tales is governed by the same
consistent but dimly apprehended instinct. Of
course, I do not pretend that he was conscious of
any such consistency; creative processes rarely are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
conscious. But he needed no reflection in order
to discover the child's view of its own world. He
never ceased to regard the world from the child's
point of view, and his personification of an old
clothes-press or a darning-needle was therefore
as natural as that of a child who beats the chair
against which it bumped its head. In the works
of more ambitious scope, where this code of conduct
would be out of place, Andersen was never
wholly at his ease. As lovers, his heroes usually
cut a sorry figure; their milk-and-water passion is
described, but it is never felt. They make themselves
a trifle ridiculous by their innocence, and
are amusing when they themselves least suspect it.
Likewise, in his autobiography, he is continually
exposing himself to ridicule by his <i>na&iuml;ve</i> candor,
and his inability to adapt himself to the etiquette
which prevails among grown-up people. Take
as an instance his visit to the Brothers Grimm,
when he asked the servant girl which of the
brothers was the more learned, and when she answered
"Jacob," he said, "Then take me to Jacob."
The little love affair, too, which he confides seems
to have been of the kind which one is apt to
experience during the pinafore period; a little
more serious, perhaps, but yet of the same kind.
It is in this vague and impersonal style that princes
and princesses love each other in the fairy-tales;
everything winds up smoothly, and there are never
any marital disagreements to darken the honeymoon.
It is in this happy, passionless realm that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
Andersen dwells, and here he reigns supreme.
For many years to come the fair creatures of his
fancy will continue to brighten the childhood of
new generations. No rival has ever entered this
realm; and even critics are excluded. Nevertheless,
Andersen need have no fear of the latter; for
even if they had the wish, they would not have
the power, to rob him of his laurels.</p>

<p>Hans Christian Andersen was born in the little
town of Odense, on the island F&uuml;nen, April 2,
1805. His father was a poor shoemaker, with
some erratic ambitions, or, if his son's word may
be trusted, a man of a richly gifted and truly
poetic mind. His wife was a few years older and
a good deal more ignorant than himself; and when
they set up housekeeping together, in a little back
room, they rejoiced in being able to nail together
a bridal bed out of the scaffolding which had recently
supported a dead nobleman's coffin. The
black mourning drapery which yet clung to the
wood gave them quite a sense of magnificence.
Their first child, Hans Christian, grew up amid
these mean surroundings, constantly worried by
the street boys, who made a butt of him, and tortured
him in the thousand ingenious ways known
to their species. He had no schooling to speak
of; but, for all that, was haunted, like Joseph,
by dreams foreshadowing his future greatness.
Guided by this premonition he started, at the age
of fourteen, for Copenhagen, a tall, ugly, and ungainly
lad, but resolved, somehow or other, to conquer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>
fame and honor. He tried himself as a
dancer, singer, actor, and failed lamentably in all
his <i>d&eacute;buts</i>. He could not himself estimate the
extent of his own ignorance, nor could he dream
what a figure he was cutting. Undismayed by all
rebuffs, though suffering agony from his wounded
vanity, he wrote poems, comedies, and tragedies, in
which he plagiarized, more or less unconsciously,
the elder Danish poets. Mr. Jonas Collins, one of
the directors of the Royal Theatre, became interested
in the youth, whose unusual ambition meant
either madness or genius. In order to determine
which it might be, Mr. Collins induced King
Frederic VI. to pay for his education, and after
half a dozen years at school Hans Christian passed
the entrance examination to the University. Mr.
Collins continued to assist him with counsel and
deed; and his hospitable house in Bredgade became
a second home to Andersen. There he met,
for the first time, people of refinement and culture
on equal terms; and his morbid self-introspection
was in a measure cured by kindly association, tempered
by wholesome fun and friendly criticism.
He now resolved to abandon his University studies
and devote his life to literature.</p>

<p>I have no doubt it would have alarmed the
gentle poet very much, if he had been told that he
belonged to the Romantic School. To be classified
in literature and be bracketed with a lot of men
with whom you are not even on speaking terms,
and whom, more than likely, you don't admire,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
would have seemed to him an unpleasant prospect.
That he drew much of his inspiration from the
German Romanticists, notably Heine and Hoffmann,
he would perhaps have admitted; but he
would have thought it unkind of you to comment
upon his indebtedness. In his first book, "A Pedestrian
Tour from Holmen Canal to the Eastern
Extremity of Amager" (1829), he assumed by turns
the <i>blas&eacute;</i> mask of the former and the fantastically
eccentric one of the latter; both of which ill became
his good-natured, plebeian, Danish countenance.
For all that, the book was a success in its
day; and no less an authority than the &aelig;sthetic
Grand Mogul, J. L. Heiberg, hailed it as a work of
no mean merit. It strikes us to-day as an exhibition
of that mocking smartness of youth which
often hides a childish heart. It was because he
was so excessively sentimental and feared to betray
his real physiognomy that he cut these excruciating
capers. His other alternative would have
been mawkishness. His vaudeville, "Love on the
Nicholas Tower," which satirizes the drama of
chivalry, is in the same vein and made a similar
hit. A volume of "Poems" was also well received.
But in 1831 he met with his first literary
reverse. A second collection of verses, entitled
"Phantasies and Sketches," was pitilessly ridiculed
by Henrik Hertz, in his "Letters from the Dead."
Andersen's lack of style and violations of syntax
were rather maliciously commented upon. If
Gabriel's trump had sounded from the top of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
Round Tower, it would not have startled Andersen
more. He was in despair. Like the great
child he was, he went about craving sympathy,
and weeping when he failed to find it.</p>

<p>"I could say nothing," he writes in "the Fairy-Tale
of My Life," "I could only let the big, heavy
waves roll over me; and it was the common opinion
that I was to be totally washed away. I felt
deeply the wound of the sharp knife; and was on
the point of giving myself up, as I was already
given up by others."</p>

<p>This is one of the numerous exhibitions of that
over-sensitiveness to criticism which caused him
such long and continued suffering. His mind was
like a bared nerve, quivering with delight or contracting
with violent pain. Utterly devoid, as he
was, of self-criticism, he regarded his authorship
as something miraculous, and held God (who apparently
supervised each chapter) responsible for
the fate of his books. "If the Lord," he writes in
solemn earnest to a friend, "will take as good care
of the remainder as he has of the first chapters,
you will like it."<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> There was to him no difference
between his best and his worst. It was all
part of himself, and he could scarcely conceive of
any motive for finding fault with it, except personal
malice, envy, animosity.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> This did not,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
however, always prevent him from associating with
the malevolent critic, as for instance in the case of
Hertz, with whom he presently established pleasant
relations.</p>

477.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_21_21" id="Footnote_21_21"></a><a href="#FNanchor_21_21"><span class="label">[21]</span></a> I derive this impression not only from the Autobiography,
but from many conversations. An account of My Acquaintance
with Hans Christian Andersen will be found in The Century
Magazine, March, 1892.</p></div>

<p>In 1831 Andersen made his first trip abroad.
"By industry and frugality," he says, "I had
saved up a little sum of money, so I resolved to
spend a couple of weeks in North Germany."</p>

<p>The result of this journey was the book "Shadow
Pictures," which was followed in 1833 by "Vignettes
on Danish Poets," and a chaplet of verse entitled
"The Twelve Months of the Year." It is
quite true, as he affirms, that in his "Vignettes,"
he "only spoke of that which was good in them"
[the poets]; but in consequence there is a great
lack of Attic salt in the book. In 1833 he went
abroad once more, visited Germany, France,
Switzerland, and Italy, and sent home the dramatic
poem "Agnete and the Merman," the comparative
failure of which was a fresh grief to him.
After his return from Rome (1835) he published
his "Improvisatore," which slowly won its way.
It was the reputation this novel gained abroad
which changed public opinion in Denmark in its
favor. A second novel, "Only a Fiddler" (1837),
is a fresh variation of his autobiography, and the
lachrymose and a trifle chaotic story, "O. T." (being
the brand of the Odense penitentiary) scarcely
deserved any better reception than was accorded
it.</p>

<p>It is a curious thing that misconception and adversity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
never hardened Andersen or toughened the
fibre of his personality. The same lamentable
lack of robustness&mdash;not to say manliness&mdash;which
marked his youth remained his prevailing characteristic
to the end of his life. And I fancy, if he
had ever reached intellectual maturity, both he
himself and the world would have been losers.
For it is his unique distinction to have expressed a
simplicity of soul which is usually dumb&mdash;which
has, at all events, nowhere else recorded itself in
literature. We all have a dim recollection of how
the world looked from the nursery window; but no
book has preserved so vivid and accurate a negative
of that marvellous panorama as Andersen's
"Wonder Tales for Children," the first collection
of which appeared in 1835. All the jumbled,
distorted proportions of things (like the reflection
of a landscape in a crystal ball) is capitally reproduced.
The fantastically personifying fancy of
childhood, where does it have more delightful
play? The radiance of an enchanted fairy realm
that bursts like an iridescent soap-bubble at the
touch of the finger of reason, where does it linger
in more alluring beauty than in "Ole Luk&ouml;ie"
("The Sandman"), "The Little Mermaid," or
"The Ice-Maiden"? There is a bloom, an indefinable,
dewy freshness about the grass, the
flowers, the very light, and the children's sweet
faces. And so vivid&mdash;so marvellously vivid&mdash;as it
all is. Listen to this from "Five in a Pea-Pod:"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"There were five peas in one pod. They were green, and
the pod was green; and so they thought that the whole
world was green. And that was just as it should be. The
pod grew and the peas grew; they accommodated themselves
to circumstances, sitting all in a row."</p></div>

<p>Or take this from "Little Tuk:"</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Yes, that was Little Tuk. His name wasn't really Tuk,
but when he couldn't speak plain, he used to call himself
so. It was meant for Charley; and it does very well, when
one only knows it."</p></div>

<p>Or this incomparable bit of drollery from Hjalmar's
dream in "The Sandman:"</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"There came a terrible wail from the table-drawer where
Hjalmar's school books lay. 'Whatever can that be?' said
the Sandman. And he went to the table and opened the
drawer. It was the slate which was in convulsions because
a wrong number had got into the sum, so that it was fairly
falling to pieces. The slate-pencil tugged and jumped at the
end of its string, as if it had been a little dog that wanted to
help the sum. But he could not. There was a great lamentation
in Hjalmar's copy-book, too; it was quite terrible
to hear. On each page the large letters stood in a row, one
underneath the other, and each with a little one at its side.
That was the copy. And next to these were a few more
letters, which thought they looked just like the others.
These were the ones Hjalmar had written. But they lay
down as if they had tumbled pell-mell over the pencil lines
upon which they were to stand.</p>

<p>"'Look, this is the way you should hold yourselves,' said
the copy, 'sloping this way with a bold swing.' 'Oh, we
should be very glad to do that,' answered Hjalmar's letters,
'but we can't. We are so weakly.' 'Then you must take<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
medicine,' said the Sandman. 'Oh, no, no,' cried they,
and straightway they stood up so gracefully that it was a
pleasure to look at them."</p></div>

<p>This strikes me as having the very movement
and all the delicious whimsicality of a school-boy's
troubled dream. It has the delectable absurdity
of the dream's inverted logic. You feel with what
beautiful zest it was written; how childishly the
author himself relished it. The illusion is therefore
perfect. The big child who played with his
puppet theatre until after he was grown up is
quite visible in every line. He is as much absorbed
in the story as any of his hearers. He is
all in the game with the intense engrossment of a
lad I knew, who, while playing Robinson Crusoe,
ate snails with relish for oysters.</p>

<p>Throughout the first series of "Wonder Tales"
there is a capital air of make-believe, which imposes
upon you most delightfully, and makes you
accept the most incredible doings, as you accept
them in a dream, as the most natural thing in the
world. In the later series, where the didactic
tale becomes more frequent ("The Pine Tree,"
"The Wind's Tale," "The Buckwheat"), there
is an occasional forced note. The story-teller becomes
a benevolent, moralizing uncle, who takes
the child upon his knee, in order to instruct while
entertaining it. But he is no more in the game.
A cloying sweetness of tone, such as sentimental
people often adopt toward children, spoils more
than one of the fables; and when occasionally he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
ventures upon a love-story ("The Rose-Elf,"
"The Old Bachelor's Nightcap," "The Porter's
Son"), he is apt to be as unintentionally amusing
as he is in telling his own love episode in "The
Fairy-Tale of My Life." However, no man can
unite the advantages of adult age and childhood,
and we all feel that there is something incongruous
in a child's talking of love.</p>

<p>It is a curious fact that his world-wide fame as
the poet of childhood never quite satisfied Andersen.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a>
He never accepted it without a protest. It
neither pleased nor sufficed him. He was especially
eager to win laurels as a dramatist; and in
1839 celebrated his first dramatic success by a
farcical vaudeville entitled "The Invisible at
Sprog&ouml;e." Then followed the romantic drama
"The Mulatto" (1840), which charmed the public
and disgusted the critics; and "The Moorish
Maiden," which disgusted both. These plays are
slipshod in construction, but emotionally effective.
The characters are loose-fibred and vague, and
have no more backbone than their author himself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
J. L. Heiberg thought it high time to chastise
the half-cultured shoemaker's son for his audacity,
and in the third act of "A Soul after Death,"
held him up to ridicule. Andersen, stabbed again
to the heart, hastened away from home, "suffering
and disconcerted." But before leaving he
published "A Picture-Book without Pictures",
(1840), which is attached to the American edition
of his "Stories and Tales," and deserves its place.
The moon's pathetic and humorous observations
on the world she looks down upon every evening
of her thirty nights' circuit have already become
classic in half-a-dozen languages. The little girl
who came to kiss the hen and beg her pardon; the
ragged street gamin who died upon the throne of
France; the Hindoo maiden who burned her lamp
upon the banks of the Ganges in order to see if
her lover was alive; the little maid who was penitent
because she laughed at the lame duckling
with a red rag around its leg&mdash;who does not know
the whole inimitable gallery from beginning to
end? The tenderest, the softest, the most virginal
spirit breathes through all these sketches.
They are sentimental, no doubt, and a trifle too
sweet. But then they belong to a period of our
lives when a little excess in that direction does not
trouble us.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_22_22" id="Footnote_22_22"></a><a href="#FNanchor_22_22"><span class="label">[22]</span></a> For verification of this statement I may refer to his indignant
letter <i>&agrave; propos</i> of the statue that was to be raised to him in Copenhagen,
in which he was represented surrounded by listening children:
"None of the sculptors," he wrote, "have known me;
none of their sketches indicate that they have seen what is characteristic
in me. Never could I read aloud when anybody was
sitting behind me or close up to me; far less if I had children on
my lap or on my back, or young Copenhageners lying all over me.
It is a <i>fa&ccedil;on de parler</i> to call me 'the children's poet.' My aim
has been to be the poet of all ages; children could not represent
me."</p></div>

<p>In 1842 Andersen gave to the world "A Poets'
Bazaar," a chronicle of his travels through nearly
all the countries of Europe. In 1844 the drama
"The King is Dreaming," and in 1845 the fairy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
comedy "The Flower of Fortune." But his
highest dramatic triumph he celebrated in the
anonymous comedy "The New Lying-in Room,"
which in a measure proved his contention that it
was personal hostility and not critical scruples
which made so large a portion of the Copenhagen
literati persecute him. For the very men who
would have been the first to hold his play up to
scorn were the heartiest in their applause, as long
as they did not know that Andersen was its author.
Less pronounced was the success of the lyrical
drama "Little Kirsten" (1846); and the somewhat
ambitious epic "Ahasverus" comes very
near being a failure. The next ventures of the versatile
and indefatigable poet were the novel "The
Two Baronesses" (1849), and the fairy comedies
"More than Pearls and Gold" (1849), adapted
from a German original, "The Sandman"<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> (1850),
and "The Elder Tree Mother" (1851). The comedies
"He was not Born" (1864), "On Langebro"
and "When the Spaniards were Here" (1869),
complete the cycle of his dramatic labors. But the
most amusing thing he did, showing how incapable
he was of taking the measure of his faculties,
was to write a novel, "To Be or Not to Be" (1857),
in which he proposed once and forever to down
the giant Unbelief, prove the immortality of the
soul, and produce "peace and reconciliation between
Nature and the Bible." It was nothing less
than the evidences of Christianity in novelistic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
form with which he designed to favor an expectant
world. "If<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> I can solve this problem," he
na&iuml;vely wrote to a friend, "then the monster materialism,
devouring everything divine, will die."
But rarely was a bigger Gulliver tackled by a tinier
Liliputian. The book not only fell flat, but
it was only the world-wide renown and the good intention
of its author which saved it from derision.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_23_23" id="Footnote_23_23"></a><a href="#FNanchor_23_23"><span class="label">[23]</span></a> Danish, Ole Luk&ouml;ie.</p></div>

<p>Though Andersen never attained in Copenhagen
an uncontested recognition of his talent, honors
both from at home and abroad were showered upon
him. The fame which undeniably was his commanded
respect, but scarcely approval. Heiberg
made merry at his obscurity in the country of his
birth and his celebrity beyond its boundaries, and
represented him as reading "The Mulatto" to the
Sultan's wives and the "Moorish Maiden" to those
who were to be strangled, kneeling in rapture,
while the Grand Eunuch, crowned his head with
laurels. But in spite of obloquy and ridicule, Andersen
continued his triumphant progress through
all the lands of the civilized world, and even beyond
it. In 1875 his tale, "The Story of a Mother,"
was published simultaneously in fifteen languages,
in honor of his seventieth birthday. A
few months later (August 4th) he died at the villa
Rolighed, near Copenhagen. His life was indeed
as marvellous as any of his tales. A gleam of
light from the wonderland in which he dwelt seems
to have fallen upon his cradle and to have illuminated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
his whole career. It was certainly in this illumination
that he himself saw it, as the opening
sentence of his autobiography proves: "My life is
a lovely fairy-tale, happy and full of incidents."</p>

<p>The softness, the sweetness, the juvenile innocence
of Danish romanticism found their happiest
expression in him; but also the superficiality, the
lack of steel in the will, the lyrical vagueness and
irresponsibility. If he did not invent a new literary
form he at all events enriched and dignified
an old one, and revealed in it a world of unsuspected
beauty. He was great in little things, and
little in great things. He had a heart of gold, a
silver tongue, and the spine of a mollusk. Like a
flaw in a diamond, a curious plebeian streak cut
straight across his nature. With all his virtues he
lacked that higher self-esteem which we call nobility.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span></p>

<h2>CONTEMPORARY DANISH LITERATURE</h2>


<p>The late Romantic authors of Denmark who
lived on the traditions of Oehlenschl&auml;ger's
time and the &aelig;sthetical doctrines of J. L. Heiberg,
have gradually been passing away; and a new
generation has grown up, which, though it knows
Joseph, has repudiated his doctrine. A period of
stagnation followed the disappearance of the Romanticists.
The Sleswick-Holstein war of 1866,
and the consequent hostility to Germany, cut off
the intellectual intercourse between the two countries
which in the first half of the century had
been lively and intimate; and as, for a while, no
new ties were formed, a respectable dulness settled
upon the little island kingdom. People lived
for the concerns of the day, earned their bread
and butter, amused themselves to the best of their
ability, but troubled themselves very little about
the battles of thought which were being fought
upon the great arena of the world. The literary
activity which now and then flared up spasmodically,
like flames over a smouldering ash-heap,
flickered and half-expired for want of fresh<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
sustenance. A direfully conventional romanticist, H. F.
Ewald (1821-1892), wrote voluminous modern
and historical novels, the heroines of which were
usually models of all the copy-book virtues, and the
heroes as bloodless as their brave and loyal prototypes
in "Ivanhoe" and "Waverley." Instead of
individualizing his <i>dramatis person&aelig;</i> this feeble
successor of Ingemann and Walter Scott gave
them a certificate of character, vouching for their
goodness or badness, and trusting the reader to
take his word for it in either case. Like many
another popular novelist, he varnished them with
the particular tint of excellence or depravity that
might suit his purpose, stuffed their heads with
bran and their bellies with sawdust, but troubled
himself little about what lay beneath the epidermis.
There was something <i>na&iuml;ve</i> and juvenile in
his view of life which appealed to the large mass
of half-educated people; and the very absence of
any subtle literary art tended further to increase
his public. Many of his books, notably "The
Youth of Valdemar Krone" (<i>Valdemar Krone's
Ungdomshistorie</i>), "The Swedes at Kronborg"
(<i>Svenskerne paa Kronborg</i>), have achieved an extraordinary
success. The former deals with contemporary
life, while the latter expurgates and
embellishes history after the manner of Walter
Scott. Two subsequent novels, "The Family
Nordby" and "Johannes Falk," are, like all of
Ewald's writings, pervaded by a robust optimism
and a warm Danish sentiment, which in a large<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
measure account for their popularity with the
public of the circulating libraries.</p>

<p>A lesser share of the same kind of popularity
has fallen to the lot of an author of a much higher
order&mdash;Wilhelm Bergs&ouml;e (born 1835). His voluminous
novel "Fra Piazza del Popolo" (1860) made a
sensation in its day, and "From the Old Factory"
(1869), which constructively is a maturer book, is
likewise full of fascination. The description of
the doings of the artistic guild in Rome, which
occupies a considerable portion of the former work,
is delightful, though intermingled with a deal of
superfluous mysticism and romantic entanglements
which were then held to be absolutely indispensable.
"In the Sabine Mountains" (1871), the
scene of which is laid in Genazzano during the
struggle for Italian independence, is a trifle too
prolix; and its effect is lessened by the old-fashioned
epistolary form. Signor Carnevale, the
revolutionary apothecary, is, however, a very
amusing figure, and would be still better if he were
not caricatured. The tendency to screw the characters
up above the normal&mdash;to tune them up to
concert pitch as it were&mdash;interferes seriously with
the pleasure which the book otherwise might
yield.</p>

<p>The conception of art as something wholly distinct
from and above nature animates all Bergs&ouml;e's
productions. The theory of fiction which R. L. Stevenson
has so eloquently propounded has
found an able practitioner in him. For all that,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
I am indebted to Bergs&ouml;e's two Italian romances for
a great deal of enjoyment, the afterglow of which
still warms my memory. But that was long ago.
A young man is apt to enjoy in a book quite as
much what he himself supplies as that which the
author has deposited therein. Each word is a
key which unlocks a store of imprisoned emotions.
The very word Italy has a magic which imparts
to it a charm even in the geography. And
Bergs&ouml;e, though he works, without suspicion of
its decrepitude, the ancient machinery of Italian
romance, is unaffectedly eloquent and unsophistically
entertaining. The historic whisperings
which he catches from the names, the ruins, the
facial types, and the very trees and grass of Genazzano
invest his letters from that picturesque neighborhood
with a certain beautiful glow of color and
a dusky richness of decay. The autobiographical
form imposes, to be sure, an increasing strain on
the reader's credulity, as the plot thickens, and
we find ourselves, half-unexpectedly, involved in a
lurid tale of monks, priests, disguised revolutionists,
cruel, mercenary fathers, etc., and the Danish
author playing his favorite <i>r&ocirc;le</i> of <i>deus ex machina</i>.
Still more incredible is the part of benevolent
Providence which he assigns to himself in "The
Bride of R&ouml;rvig," where he saves the heroine's life
by restoring to her a ring given to her lover, and
thus assuring her that he is alive when she believes
him dead. The autobiographical story (especially
when the writer is a mere convenient supernumerary,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>
designed, like the uncle from America
in the old-fashioned melodrama, to straighten out
the tangled skein), is apt to involve other difficulties
than the mere embarrassment of having to distrust
the author's assertion, or censure his indiscretions.
The illusion is utterly spoiled by that haunting
<i>arri&egrave;re pens&eacute;e</i> that this or that writer, whom you
know perhaps at first or second-hand, or whose
features, at all events, are familiar to you from
pictures, never could or would have played the
more or less heroic <i>r&ocirc;le</i> with which he here delights
to impose upon you.</p>

<p>Altogether the best book which Bergs&ouml;e has
written is the autobiographical romance "From
the Old Factory," the scene of which is laid in
Denmark. This book evidently contains a great
deal of genuine reminiscence, and is therefore devoid
of that air of laborious contrivance and artificial
intrigue which brings the foregoing novels
into such unpleasant relationship with Wilkie
Collins and his <i>genre</i>. The incidents of the hero's
boyhood in the old porcelain factory, and his
uncle's agitating experiments for the rediscovery
of a lost process of glazing are saner and soberer
and lie closer to the soil of common experience
than the exploits of monks and pirates and revolutionists.</p>

<p>Among the notable men of the expiring Danish
romanticism Meyer Aaron Goldschmidt (1819-1886)
holds a leading position. A comic paper,
<i>Corsaren</i>, which he edited (1840-1846) made a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
tremendous stir in its day; and its scathing wit
and satire were not without influence upon current
events. His two novels, <i>En J&ouml;de</i> (1845),
<i>Hjeml&ouml;s</i> (1857), and a large number of clever
novelettes (<i>Ravnen</i>, <i>Arvingen Flyveposten</i>, etc.),
are full of psychological subtleties, and often charmingly
told. <i>Flyveposten</i> ("The Flying Mail") was
translated into English (Boston and Cambridge,
1870) but attracted no particular attention. For all
that, Goldschmidt, in spite of occasional prolixity,
stands the test of time remarkably well. His
Jewish stories, notably <i>Maser, Aron og Esther</i>, and
<i>En J&ouml;de</i>, contain a higher order of work, though
less dramatically effective, than that of Sacher-Masoch,
and Emil Franzos, and the later Ghetto
romancers. Goldschmidt's double nationality, as a
Danish-born Jew, indicates his position and the
source from which he drew his weakness and his
strength. As a Jew he saw and judged the Danish
character, and as a Dane he saw and judged the
Jewish character with a liberality and insight of
which no autochthon would have been capable.
For all that his tales aroused anything but friendly
feelings among his own people. They felt it to
be a profanation thus to expose the secluded domestic
and religious life of the children of Israel.
It is to this sentiment that Dr. Brandes has given
utterance in his protest against "perpetually serving
up one's grandmother with sauce piquante."</p>

<p>An author who is born into an age of transition,
when old faiths are passing away and new ones<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
are struggling for recognition, is placed in a serious
dilemma. Where he makes his choice by
mere temperamental bias, he is apt to miss that
element of growth which is involved in every
spiritual struggle. But if, as is so frequently the
case, he finds his choice in a measure made for
him, his education, kinships, and worldly advantage
identifying him with the established order,
it takes a tremendous amount of courage and character
to break away from old moorings and steer,
without other compass than a sensitive conscience,
toward the rosy dawn of the unknown. There
was a desperate need of such men in Denmark in
the seventies, when the little kingdom was sinking
deeply and more deeply into a bog of patriotic delusion
and spiritual stagnation. An infusion of
new blood was needed&mdash;a re-establishment of that
circulation of thought which keeps the whole
civilized world in vital connection and makes it
akin. No country can cut itself off from this
universal world-life without withering like a diseased
limb. The man who undertook to bring
Denmark again into <i>rapport</i> with Europe was Dr.
Georg Brandes, whom I have characterized at
length in another essay. It was his admirable
book, "The Men of the Modern Transition" (translated
into German under the title <i>Moderne Geister</i>)
which impelled me, some years ago, to make the
acquaintance of the three authors who represent
whatever there is of promise in contemporary
Danish literature, viz., Sophus Schandorph, Holger<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
Drachmann, and J. P. Jacobsen. The last
named, who died (1884) in the flower of his young
manhood, is, perhaps, not in the strictest sense
contemporary. But he is indispensable to the
characterization of the group.</p>

<p>Widely different as these three men are in almost
everything, they have this in common, that
they have deeply breathed the air of the nineteenth
century; and they all show more or less the
influence of Brandes. That this influence has been
direct and personal seems probable from the relation
which they have sustained to the revolutionary
critics. Of this I am, however, by no means sure.
Mr. Jacobsen, who was by profession a botanist,
and translated Darwin into Danish, no doubt
came by his "advanced views" at first hand. In
the case of Schandorph it is more difficult to
judge. He is an excellent linguist, and may have
had access to the same sources from which Brandes
drew his strength. Drachmann is so vacillating
in his tendencies that he refuses to be permanently
classified in any school of art or thought. Of the
three, Schandorph seems altogether the maturest
mind and furnishes the most finished and satisfactory
work. In his novel "Without a Centre"
(<i>Uden Midtpunkt</i>) the reader feels himself at once
face to face with an interesting and considerable
personality. He has that sense of surprise and delighted
expectation which only the masters of
fiction are apt to evoke. It is a story of a Danish
national type&mdash;the conversational artist. In no<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>
country in the world is there such a conversational
fury as in Denmark. A people has, of course, to
do something with its surplus energy; and as political
opposition is sure to prove futile, there is
nothing left to do but to talk&mdash;not only politics,
but art, poetry, religion, in fact, everything under
the sun. At the time, however, when Albrecht,
the hero of "Without a Centre," plied his nimble
tongue, the country had a more liberal Government,
and criticism of the Ministry was not yet
high treason. But centuries of repression and the
practical exclusion of the bourgeoisie from public
life were undoubtedly the fundamental causes
of this abnormal conversational activity. There
is something soft and emotional in the character
of the Danes, which distinguishes them from
their Norwegian and Swedish kinsmen&mdash;an easily
flowing lyrical vein, which imparts a winning
warmth and cordiality to their demeanor. Socially
they are the most charming people in the
world. Also in this respect Albrecht is typical,
and the songs in which he gives vent to his lyrical
moods have such a rapturous melody that they
keep humming in the brain long after the reader
has closed the book. It almost follows as a psychological
necessity that a man so richly endowed
with the gift of speech is feeble and halting in
action. Like Tourgu&eacute;neff's "Rudin," who suffered
from the same malady, he gains by the brilliancy
and novelty of his speech the love of a noble
young girl, who, taking his phrases at their face<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
value, believes his heart to be as heroic as his
tongue. Like him, too, he fails in the critical moment;
nay, restrained by petty scruples, he even
stays away from the rendezvous, and by his
cowardice loses what by his eloquence he had
won.</p>

<p>A second novel, "Common People," which deals
with low life in its most varied phases, shows the
same admirable truthfulness and exactness in the
character drawing, the same refreshing humor and
universal sympathy and comprehension. "The
Story of Thomas Friis" undertakes to show, in the
career of a Danish youth who is meant to be typical,
the futility of the vainglorious imaginings
with which the little nation has inflated itself to a
size out of proportion to its actual historic <i>r&ocirc;le</i>.
In "The Old Pharmacy" the necessity of facing
the changed reality of the modern world, instead
of desperately hugging an expiring past, is enforced
in a series of vivid and vigorous pictures of
provincial life. "The Forester's Children," which
is one of the latest of this author's novels, suffers
by comparison with its predecessors, but is yet full
of cleverness and smacks of the soil.</p>

<p>Schandorph's naturalism is not pathological;
not in the nature of an autopsy or a diagnosis of
disease. It is full-blooded and vigorous&mdash;not particularly
squeamish&mdash;but always fresh and wholesome.
His shorter tales and sketches ("From the
Province," "Five Stories," "Novelettes") are of
more unequal merit, but are all more or less<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
strongly characterized by the qualities which fascinate
in his novels. Of his poems "<i>Samlede
Digte</i>," (1882) I have not the space to speak, and
can only regret that they are written in a language
in which they will remain as hidden from the
world as if they had been imprinted in cuneiform
inscriptions upon Assyrian bricks. They are
largely occasional and polemical; and more remarkable
for vigor of thought than sweetness of
melody.</p>

<p>J. P. Jacobsen, the second in the group to
which I have referred, was a colorist of a very
eminent type, both in prose and verse; but his
talent lacked that free-flowing, spontaneous abundance&mdash;that
charming air of improvisation&mdash;with
which Schandorph captivates his reader, takes him
into his confidence, and overwhelms him with entertainment.
Jacobsen painted faces better than
he did souls; or, rather, he did not seem to think
the latter worth painting, unless they exhibited
some abnormal mood or trait. There is something
forced and morbid in his people&mdash;a lack of free
movement and natural impulse. His principal
work, "Mistress Marie Grubbe," is a series of anxiously
finished pictures, carefully executed in the
minutest details, but failing somehow to make a
complete impression. Each scene is so bewilderingly
surcharged with color that, as in the case of
a Gobelin tapestry, one has to be at a distance before
one discovers the design. There is something
almost wearisome in the far-fetched words with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
which he piles up picturesque effects, returning
every now and then to put in an extra touch&mdash;to
tip a feather with light, to brighten the sheen of
his satins, to polish the steely lustre of swords and
armors. Yet, if one takes the time to linger over
these unusual words and combinations of words,
one is likely to find that they are strong and appropriate.
All conventional shop-work he disdained;
the traditional phrases for eyes, lips, brow,
and hair were discarded, not necessarily because
they were bad, but because by much use they have
lost their freshness. They have come to be mere
sounds, and no longer call up vivid conceptions.
An author who has the skill and the courage to
undertake this repolishing and resharpening of the
tools of language is, indeed, a public benefactor;
but it requires the finest linguistic taste and discrimination
to do it with success. Most authors
are satisfied if they succeed in giving currency to
one happy phrase involving a novel use of the language,
or to an extremely limited number; I know
of no one who has undertaken the renovation of
his mother-tongue on so extensive a scale as Jacobsen.
To say that he has in most cases done it
well is, therefore, high praise. "Mistress Marie
Grubbe" is not, however, easy reading; and the
author's novelettes, entitled "Mogens and Other
Stories," seem to be written, primarily, for literary
connoisseurs, as their interest as mere stories is
scarcely worth considering. They are, rather,
essays in the art of saying things unusually and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
yet well. They do not seem to me, even in this
respect, a success. There are single phrases that
seem almost an inspiration; there are bits of description,
particularly of flowers and moods of nature,
which are masterly; but the studious avoidance
of the commonplace imparts to the reader
something of the strain under which the author
has labored. He begins to feel the sympathetic
weariness which often overcomes one while watching
acrobatic feats.</p>

<p>In Jacobsen's third book, "Niels Lyhne," we
have again the story of a Danish Rudin&mdash;a nature
with a multitude of scattered aspirations, squandering
itself in brilliant talk and fantastic yearnings.
It is the same coquetting with the "advanced"
ideas of the age, the same lack of mental
stamina, the same wretched surrender and failure.
It is the complexion of a period which the author
is here attempting to give, and he takes pains to
emphasize its typical character. One is almost
tempted to believe that Shakespeare, by a gift of
happy divination, made his Prince of Denmark
conform to this national type, though in his day it
could not have been half as pronounced as it is
now. Whether the Dane of the sixteenth century
was yet the eloquent mollusk which we are perpetually
encountering in modern Danish fiction is
a question which, at this distance, it is hard to
decide. The type, of course, is universal, and is
to be found in all countries. Only in the English
race, on both sides of the Atlantic, it is comparatively<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
rare. That a vigorous race like the
Danish, confined, as it is in modern times, within
a narrow arena of action (and forbidden to do anything
on that), should have developed it to a rare
perfection seems, as I have already remarked, almost
a psychological necessity.</p>

<p>Holger Drachmann, in his capacity of lyrist, has
also a strain of the Hamlet nature; although, in
the case of a poet, whose verses are in themselves
deeds, the assertion contains no reproach. I am
not even sure that the Protean quality of Drachmann's
verse&mdash;its frequent voicing of naturally
conflicting tendencies&mdash;need be a matter of reproach.
A poet has the right to sing in any key
in which he can sing well; and Drachmann sings,
as a rule, exceedingly well. But, like most people
with a fine voice, he is tempted to sing too
much; and it thus happens that verses of slipshod
and hasty workmanship are to be found in his volumes.
In his first book of "Poems" he was a
free oppositional lance, who carried on a melodious
warfare against antiquated institutions and
opinions, and gave a thrust here and a thrust there
in behalf of socialists, communists, and all sorts of
irregular characters. Since that time his radical,
revolutionary sympathies have had time to cool,
and in each succeeding volume he has appeared
more sedate, conservative, <i>bourgeois</i>.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> In a later
volume of poems this transformation is half symbolically<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
indicated in the title, "Tempered Melodies."
Nor is it to be denied that his melodies
have gained in beauty by this process of tempering.
There is a wider range of feeling, greater
charm of expression, and a deeper resonance.
Half a dozen volumes of verse which he has published
since ("Songs of the Ocean," "Venezia,"
"Vines and Roses," "Youth in Verse and Song,"
"Peder Tordenskjold," "Deep Chords") are of
very unequal worth, but establish beyond question
their author's right to be named among the few
genuine poets of the latter half of the nineteenth
century; nay, more than that, he belongs in the
foremost rank of those who are yet surviving. His
prose, on the other hand, seems aimless and chaotic,
and is not stamped with any eminent characteristics.
A volume of short stories, entitled
"Wild and Tame," partakes very much more of
the latter adjective than of the former. The first
of the tales, "Inclined Planes," is a discursive
family chronicle, showing the decadence of a fishing
village under the influence of city boarders.
The second, "Love and Despatches," inculcates a
double moral, the usefulness of economy and the
uselessness of mothers-in-law; and the third,
"The Cutter Wild Duck," is a shudderingly insipid
composition about a village lion who got
drunk on his birthday, fell overboard, and committed
no end of follies. A later volume of "Little
Tales" is, indeed, so little as scarcely to have
any excuse for being. The stories have all more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>
or less of a marine flavor; but the only one of
them that has a sufficient <i>motif</i>, rationally developed,
is one entitled "How the Pilot Got his
Music-box." The novel, "A Supernumerary,"
is also a rather weak performance, badly constructed,
and overloaded with chaotic incidents.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_25_25" id="Footnote_25_25"></a><a href="#FNanchor_25_25"><span class="label">[25]</span></a> Since this was written Drachmann has undergone a fresh
transformation, and is said to have returned to the radical camp.</p></div>

<p><i>V&ouml;lund Smed</i> (1895) is a cycle of spirited poems
dealing with the tragic fate of Weland the Smith,
who took such a savage vengeance upon the King
for having maimed and crippled him. The legend
is invested with an obvious symbolic significance,
and seems to have been intended as a poetic declaration
of independence&mdash;a revolutionary manifesto
signalizing the Drachmann's re-espousal of the radical
opinions of his youth, in his allegiance to which
he had, perhaps, out of regard for worldly advantages
been inclined to waver.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<h2>GEORG BRANDES</h2>



<p>It is a greater achievement in a critic to gain an
international fame than in a poet or a writer
of fiction. The world is always more ready to be
amused than to be instructed, and the literary purveyor
of amusement has opportunities for fame ten
times greater than those which fall to the lot of
the literary instructor. The epic delight&mdash;the delight
in fable and story&mdash;to which the former appeals,
is a fundamental trait in human nature; it
appears full grown in the child, and has small need
of cultivation. But the faculty of generalization
to which the critic appeals is indicative of a stage
of intellectual development to which only a small
minority even of our so-called cultivated public attains.
It is therefore a minority of a minority
which he addresses, the intellectual <i>&eacute;lite</i> which
does the world's thinking. To impress these is far
more difficult than to impress the multitude; for
they are already surfeited with good writing, and
are apt to reject with a shoulder-shrug whatever
does not coincide with their own tenor of thought.</p>

<p>What I mean by a critic in this connection is not
a witty and agreeable <i>causeur</i>, like the late Jules
Janin, who, taking a book for his text, discoursed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
entertainingly about everything under the sun;
but an interpreter of a civilization and a representative
of a school of thought who sheds new light
upon old phenomena&mdash;men like Lessing, Matthew
Arnold, and Taine. The latest candidate for admission
to this company, whose title, I think, no
one who has read him will dispute, is the Dane,
Georg Brandes.</p>

<p>Dr. Brandes was born in Copenhagen in 1842,
and is accordingly fifty-three years of age (1895).
At the age of seventeen he entered the University
of his native city, devoting himself first to jurisprudence,
and occupying himself later with philosophical
and &aelig;sthetical studies. In 1862 he gained
the gold medal of the University by an essay on
"Fatalism among the Ancients," which showed a
surprising brilliancy of expression and maturity of
thought; and soon after he passed his examination
for the doctorate of philosophy with the highest
distinction. It is told that the old poet Hauch,
who was then Professor of &AElig;sthetics at the University,
was so much impressed by the young doctor's
ability that he hoped to make him his successor.
And toward this end Dr. Brandes began to
bend his energies. During the next five or six
years he travelled on the Continent, spending the
winter of 1865 in Stockholm, that of 1866-67 in
Paris, and sojourning, moreover, for longer or
shorter periods in the principal cities of Germany.
He became a most accomplished linguist, speaking
French and German almost as fluently as his mother-tongue;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
and, being an acute observer as well as an
earnest student, he acquired an equipment for the
position to which he aspired which distanced all
competitors. But in Denmark, as elsewhere, cosmopolitan
culture does not constitute the strongest
claim to a professorship. In his book, "The Dualism
in Our Most Recent Philosophy" (1866),
Brandes took up the dangerous question of the relation
of science to religion, and treated it in a spirit
which aroused antagonism on the part of the conservative
and orthodox party.</p>

<p>This able treatise, though it may not be positivism
pure and simple, shows a preponderating influence
of Comte and his school, and its attitude
toward religion is approximately that of Herbert
Spencer and Stuart Mill. The constellation under
which Brandes was born into the world of thought
was made up of the stars Darwin, Comte, Taine,
and Mill. These men put their stamp upon his
spirit; and to the tendency which they represent
he was for many years faithful. Mill's book on
"The Subjection of Women" he has translated
into Danish (1869), and he has written besides a
charmingly sympathetic essay, containing personal
reminiscences, of that grave and conscientious
thinker, whose "Autobiography" is perhaps the
saddest book in the English language.</p>

<p>The three next books of Brandes, which all
deal with &aelig;sthetical subjects ("&AElig;sthetic Studies,"
1868, "Criticisms and Portraits," 1870, and
"French &AElig;sthetics at the Present Day"), are full<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
of pith and winged felicities of phrase. It is a
delight to read them. The passage of Scripture
often occurs to me when I take up these earlier
works of Brandes: "He rejoiceth like a strong
man to run a race." He handles language with
the zest and vigor of conscious mastery. There is
no shade of meaning which is so subtle as to elude
his grip. Things which I should have said, <i>a
priori</i>, were impossible to express in Danish he
expresses with scarcely a sign of effort; and however
new and surprising his phrase is, it is never
awkward, never cumbrous, never apparently conscious
of its brilliancy.</p>

<p>I do not mean to say that these linguistic excellences
are characteristic only of Dr. Brandes's
earlier works; but, either because he has accustomed
us to expect much of him in this respect, or
because he has come to regard such brilliancy as of
minor consequence, it is a fact that two of his latest
hooks ("Impressions of Poland" and "Impressions
of Russia") contain fewer memorable phrases,
fewer winged words, fewer <i>mots</i> with a flavor of
Gallic wit. Intellectually these "Impressions"
are no less weighty; nay, they are more weighty
than anything from the same pen that has preceded
them. They show a faculty to enter sympathetically
into an alien civilization, to seize upon
its characteristic phases, to steal into its confidence,
as it were, and coax from it its intimate secrets;
and they exhibit, moreover, an acuteness of observation
and an appreciation of significant trifles (or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
what to a superficial observer might appear trifles)
which no previous work on the Slavonic nations
had displayed. It is obvious that Dr. Brandes
here shuns the linguistic pyrotechnics in which,
for instance, De Amicis indulges in his pictures of
Holland and the Orient. It is the matter, rather
than the manner, which he has at heart; and he
apparently takes a curb bit between his teeth in
the presence of the Kremlin of Moscow and the
palaces of St. Petersburg, in order to restrain mere
pictorial expression.</p>

<p>Having violated chronology in speaking of these
two works out of their order, I shall have to leap
back over a score of years and contemplate once
more the young doctor of philosophy who returned
to Copenhagen in 1872 and began a course of trial
lectures at the University on modern literature.
The lecturer here flies his agnostic colors from beginning
to end. He treats "The Romantic School
in Germany" as Voltaire treated Rousseau&mdash;with
sovereign wit, superior intelligence, but scant sympathy.
At the same time he penetrates to the
fountains of life which infused strength into the
movement. He accounts for romanticism as the
chairman of a committee <i>de lunatico inquirendo</i>
might account for a case of religious mania.</p>

<p>The second and third courses of lectures (printed,
like the first, and translated into German by
Strodtmann) dealt with "The Literature of the
French Emigr&eacute;s" and "The Reaction in France."
Here the critic is less unsympathetic, not because<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
he regards the mental attitude of the fugitives from
the Revolution with approbation, but because he
has an intellectual bias in favor of everything
French. Besides having a certain constitutional
sympathy with the clearness and vigor of style
and thought which distinguish the French, Dr.
Brandes is so largely indebted to French science,
philosophy, and art that it would be strange if he
did not betray an occasional <i>soup&ccedil;on</i> of partisanship.
His treatment of Chateaubriand, Benjamin
Constant, Madame de Sta&euml;l, Oberman, Madame de
Kr&uuml;dener, and all the queer saints and scribbling
sinners of that period is as entertaining as it is instructive.
It gives one the spiritual complexion
of the period in clear lines and vivid colors, which
can never be forgotten. Nearly all that makes
France France is to be found in these volumes&mdash;its
wit, its frivolity, its bright daylight sense, contrasting
so strikingly with the moonshiny mysticism of
German romanticism. And yet France has its
romanticism too, which finds vent in a supercredulous
religiosity, in a pictorial sentimentalized Christianity,
such as we encounter in Chateaubriand's
"G&eacute;nie du Christianisme" and "Les Martyrs."
It is with literary phenomena of this order that
"The Reaction in France" particularly deals.</p>

<p>The fourth course of lectures, entitled "Byron
and his Group," though no less entertaining than
the rest, appears to me less satisfactory. It is a
clever presentation of Byron's case against the
British public; but the case of the British against<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span>
Byron is inadequately presented. It is the pleading
of an able advocate, not the charge of an impartial
judge. Dr. Brandes has so profound an
admiration for the man who dares to rebel that he
fails to do justice to the motives of society in protecting
itself against him. It is not to be denied
that the iconoclast may be in the right and society
in the wrong; but it is by no means a foregone
conclusion that such is the case. If society did not,
with the fierce instinct of self-preservation, guard
its traditional morality against such assailants as
Byron and Shelley, civilization would suffer. The
conservative bias of the Philistine (though not so
outwardly attractive) is no less valuable as a factor
in civilization than the iconoclastic zeal of the reformer.
If the centrifugal force had full sway in
human society, without being counteracted by a
centripetal tendency, anarchy would soon prevail.
I cannot (as Dr. Brandes appears to do) discover
any startling merit in outraging the moral sense of
the community in which one lives; and though I
may admit that a man who was capable of doing
this was a great poet, I cannot concede that the
fact of his being a great poet justified the outrage.
Nor am I sure that Dr. Brandes means to imply so
much; but in all of his writings there is manifested
a deep sympathy with the law-breaker whose Titanic
soul refuses to be bound by the obligations of
morality which limit the freedom of ordinary mortals.
Only petty and pusillanimous souls, according
to him, submit to these restraints; the heroic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
soul breaks them, as did Byron and Shelley, because
he has outgrown them, or because he is too great
to recognize the right of any power to limit his
freedom of action or restrain him in the free assertion
of his individuality. This is the undertone
in everything Dr. Brandes has written; but nowhere
does it ring out more boldly than in his treatment
of Byron and Shelley, unless it be in the fifth course
of his "Main Currents" dealing with "Young
Germany."</p>

<p>These four courses of lectures have been published
under the collective title "The Main Literary
Currents in the Nineteenth Century"
(<i>Hovedstr&ouml;mningerne i det Nittende Aarhundredes
Litteratur</i>). The German translation is entitled
<i>Hauptstr&ouml;mungen in der Litteratur des Neunzehnten
Jahrhunderts</i>. Barring the strictures which
I have made, I know no work of contemporary criticism
which is more luminous in its statements,
more striking in its judgments, and more replete
with interesting information. It reminds one in
its style of Taine's "Lectures on Art" and the
"History of English Literature." The intellectual
bias is kindred, if not the same; as is also the pictorial
vigor of the language, the subtle deductions
of psychical from physical facts, and a certain
lusty realism, which lays hold of external nature
with a firm grip.</p>

<p>In Dr. Brandes's "Impressions of Poland" I
found an observation which illustrates his extraordinary
power of characterization. The temperament<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
of the Polish people, he says, is not rational
but fantastically heroic. When I recall the personalities
of the various Poles I have known (and I
have known a great many), I cannot conceive of a
phrase more exquisitely descriptive. It makes all
your haphazard knowledge about Poland significant
and valuable by supplying you with a key
to its interpretation. It is this faculty Dr.
Brandes has displayed in an eminent degree in his
many biographical and critical essays which have
appeared in German and Danish periodicals; as
also in his more elaborate biographies of Benjamin
Disraeli (1878), Esaias Tegn&eacute;r (1878), S&ouml;ren Kierkegaard
(1877), Ferdinand Lassalle (1882), and
Ludwig Holberg. The first of these was translated
into English, and was also published in the
United States. A second volume, entitled "Eminent
Writers of the Nineteenth Century," was
translated some years ago by Professor R. B. Anderson.
The greater number of these highly
finished essays were selected from the Danish volumes
"The Men of the New Transition" (1884)
and "Men and Works in Recent European Literature"
(1883), and one or two from "Danish Poets"
(1877). They give in every instance the keynote
to the personality with which they deal; they are
not so much studies of books as studies of the men
who are revealed in the books. Take, for instance,
the essay on Bj&ouml;rnstjerne Bj&ouml;rnson, which I regard
as one of the finest and most vital pieces of
critical writing in recent times. What can be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
more subtly descriptive of the very innermost soul
of this poet than the picture of him as the clansman,
the Norse chieftain, who feels with the many
and speaks for the many; and what more beautifully
indicative of his external position than this
phrase: "To mention his name is like running up
the flag of Norway"?</p>

<p>It seems peculiarly appropriate to follow up this
essay with one on Ibsen, who is as complete an
antithesis to his great and popular rival as could
well be conceived. There is no bugle-call in the
name Henrik Ibsen. It is thin in sound, and can
be spoken almost with closed lips. You have no
broad vowels and large consonants to fill your
mouth as when you say Bj&ouml;rnstjerne Bj&ouml;rnson.
This difference in sound seems symbolic. Ibsen is
the solitary man, a scathing critic of society, a delver
in the depths of human nature, sceptical of all
that men believe in and admire. He has not, like
Bj&ouml;rnson, any faith in majorities; nay, he believes
that the indorsement of the majority is an argument
against the wisdom of a course of action or
the truth of a proposition. The summary of this
poet's work and personality in Dr. Brandes's book
is a masterpiece of analytical criticism. It enriches
and expands the territory of one's thought.
It is no less witty, no less epigrammatic, than
Sainte-Beuve at his best; and it has flashes of
deeper insight than I have ever found in Sainte-Beuve.</p>

<p>The last book of Dr. Brandes's that has been presented<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
to the American public is his "Impressions
of Russia." The motto of this work (which
in the Danish edition is printed on the back of the
title-page) is "Black Earth," the significance of
which is thus explained in the concluding paragraph:</p>

<p>"Black earth, fertile soil, new soil, wheat soil ... the
wide, rich, warm nature ... the
infinite expanses, which fill the soul with melancholy
and with hope ... the impenetrable,
duskily mysterious ... the mother-womb of
new realities and new mysticism ... Russia,
the future."</p>

<p>The prophetic vagueness of this paragraph, big
with dim possibilities, conveys the very impression
to which all observations and experiences in Russia
finally reduce themselves. It is the enduring
residue which remains when all evanescent impressions
have lapsed into the background. It expresses,
too, the typical mental attitude of every
Russian, be he ever so Frenchified and denationalized.
The word "Virgin Soil" was a favorite
phrase with Tourgu&eacute;neff when speaking of his
country, and he used it as the title of his last
novel. It seemed to him to explain everything in
Russian conditions that to the rest of the world appeared
enigmatical. The whole of Dr. Brandes's
book is interpenetrated with this consciousness of
the vast possibilities hidden in the virgin bosom of
the new earth, even though they may be too deeply
hidden to sprout up into the daylight for centuries<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
to come. The Russian literature, which is
at present enchaining the attention of the civilized
world, is a brilliant variation of this theme, an
imaginative commentary on this text. The second
half of Dr. Brandes's "Impressions" is devoted to
the consideration of Puschkin, Gogol, Lermontoff,
Dostojevski, Tourgu&eacute;neff, and Tolsto&iuml;; of each of
whom he gives, as it appears to me, a better account
than M. de Vog&uuml;&eacute; in his book "Le Roman
Russe," which gave him a seat among the Forty
Immortals.</p>

<p>The significance of Dr. Brandes's literary activity,
which has now extended over a quarter of a
century, can hardly be estimated from our side of
the Atlantic. The Danish horizon was, twenty
years ago, hedged in on all sides by a patriotic prejudice
which allowed few foreign ideas to enter.
As previously stated, the people had, before the
two Sleswick-Holstein wars, been in lively communication
with Germany, and the intellectual
currents of the Fatherland had found their way up
to the Belts, and had pulsated there, though with
some loss of vigor. But the disastrous defeat in
the last war aroused such hostility to Germany
that the intellectual intercourse almost ceased.
German ideas became scarcely less obnoxious than
German bayonets. Spiritual stagnation was the
result. For no nation can with impunity cut itself
off from the great life of the world. New connections
might, perhaps, have been formed with
France or England; but the obstacles in the way<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
of such connections appeared too great to be readily
overcome. Racial differences and consequent
alienism in habits of thought made a <i>rapprochement</i>
seem hopeless. It seemed, for awhile, as if
the war had cut down the intellectual territory of
the Danes even more than it had curtailed their
material area. They cultivated their little domestic
virtues, talked enthusiastic nonsense on festive
occasions, indulged in vain hopes of recovering
their lost provinces, but rarely allowed their political
reverses to interfere with their amusements.
They let the world roar on past their gates, without
troubling themselves much as to what interested
or agitated it. A feeble, moonshiny late-romanticism
was predominant in their literature;
and in art, philosophy, and politics that sluggish
conservatism which betokens a low vitality, incident
upon intellectual isolation.</p>

<p>What was needed at such a time was a man who
could re-attach the broken connection&mdash;a mediator
and interpreter of foreign thought in such a form
as to appeal to the Danish temperament and be
capable of assimilation by the Danish intellect.
Such a man was Georg Brandes. He undertook
to put his people <i>en rapport</i> with the nineteenth
century, to open new avenues for the influx of
modern thought, to take the place of those which
had been closed. We have seen that he interpreted
to his countrymen the significance of the
literary and social movements both in England and
in France. But a self-satisfied and virtuous little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
nation which regards its remoteness from the great
world as a matter of congratulation is not apt to
receive with favor such a champion of alien ideas.
The more the Danes became absorbed in their
national hallucinations, the more provincial, nay
parochial, they became in their interests, the less
did they feel the need of any intellectual stimulus
from abroad; and when Dr. Brandes introduced
them to modern realism, agnosticism, and positivism
they thanked God that none of these dreadful
isms were indigenous with them; and were
disposed to take Dr. Brandes to task for disturbing
their idyllic, orthodox peace by the promulgation
of such dangerous heresies. When the time
came to fill the professorship for which he was a
candidate, he was passed by, and a safer but inferior
man was appointed. A formal crusade was
opened against him, and he was made the object of
savage and bitter attacks. I am not positive, but
am disposed to believe, that it was this crusade, not
against his opinions only, but against the man
himself, which drove Dr. Brandes from Copenhagen,
and induced him, in October, 1877, to settle
in Berlin. Here he continued his literary activity
with unabated zeal, became a valued contributor
to the most authoritative German periodicals, and
gained a conspicuous position among German men
of letters. But while he was sojourning abroad,
the seed of ideas which he had left at home began
to sprout, and in 1882 his friends in Copenhagen
felt themselves strong enough to brave the antagonism<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
which his &aelig;sthetical and religious heresies
had aroused. At their invitation he returned to
Denmark, having been guaranteed an income of
four thousand crowns ($1,000) for ten years, with
the single stipulation that he should deliver an
annual course of public lectures in Copenhagen.
Since then his reputation has spread rapidly
throughout the civilized world; his books have
been translated into many languages, and he would
have won his way to a recognition, as the foremost
of contemporary critics, if he had not in his later
publications discredited himself by his open sympathy
with anarchism.</p>

<p>In order to substantiate this it is only necessary
to call attention to the fifth volume of his lectures
entitled "Young Germany" (<i>Det unge Tydskland</i>,
1890), which betrays extraordinary intellectual acumen
but also a singular confusion of moral values.
All revolt is lauded, all conformity derided. The
former is noble, daring, Titanic; the latter is
pusillanimous and weak. Conjugal irregularities
are treated not with tolerance but with obvious
approval. Those authors who dared be a law unto
themselves are, by implication at least, praised for
flinging down their gauntlets to the dull, moral
Philistines who have shackled themselves with
their own stupid traditions. That is the tone of
Brandes's comment upon such relations as that of
Immermann to Eliza von L&uuml;tzow.</p>

<p>But nowhere has he unmasked so Mephistophelian
a countenance as in his essays on Luther and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
on an obscure German iconoclast named Friedrich
Nietschke (<i>Essays: Fremmede Personligheder</i>,
pp. 151-244). It is difficult to understand how a
man of well-balanced brain and a logical equipment
second to none, can take <i>au s&eacute;rieux</i> a mere
philosophical savage who dances a war-dance amid
what he conceives to be the ruins of civilization,
swings a reckless tomahawk and knocks down
everybody and everything that comes in his way.
There must lie a long history of disappointment
and bitterness behind that endorsement of anarchy
pure and simple. And it is the sadder to contemplate
because it casts a sinister light upon Dr.
Brandes's earlier activity and compels many an
admirer of his literary art to revise his previous
opinion of him. Can a man ever have been a
sound thinker who at fifty practically hoists the
standard of anarchy? A ship is scarcely to be
trusted that flies such compromising colors.</p>

<p>That all development, in order to be rational,
must have its roots in the past&mdash;must be in the nature
of a slow organic growth&mdash;is certainly a fundamental
proposition of the Spencerian sociology. It
is the more to be wondered at that an evolutionist
like Dr. Brandes, in his impatience at the tardiness
of social progress, should lose his philosophic
temper and make common cause with a crack-brained
visionary. The kind of explosive radicalism
which Nietschke betrays in his cynical questions
and explanations is no evidence of profundity
or sagacity, but is the equivalent of the dynamiter's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
activity, transferred to the world of thought.
His pretended re-investigation of the foundations
of the moral sentiments reminds one of the mud
geysers of the Yellowstone, which break out periodically
and envelop everything within reach in
an indeterminate shower of mud. To me there is
more of vanity than of philosophic acumen in his
onslaught on well-nigh all human institutions. He
would, like Ibsen, no doubt,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Place 'neath the ark the torpedo most cheerfully;"<br /></span>

<p>but torpedoes of his making would scarcely do the
ark much harm. They have not the explosive
power of Ibsen's. There are in every age men who,
unable to achieve the fame of Dinocrates, who
built the temple of the Ephesian Diana, aspire to
that of Herostratos, who destroyed it. To admire
these men is as compromising as to be admired by
them.</p>

<p>In the essay on "Martin Luther on Celibacy
and Marriage" Dr. Brandes derides with a satyr-like
leer all traditional ideas of chastity, conjugal
fidelity, and marital honor.</p>

<p>Though he pretends to fight behind Luther's
shield the deftest thrusts are not the reformer's,
but the essayist's own. Fundamentally, I fancy,
this is an outbreak of that artistic paganism which
is so prevalent among the so-called "advanced"
Hebrews. The idea that obedience to law is degrading;
that conformity to traditional morals is
soul-crippling and unworthy of a free spirit; that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
only by giving sway to passion will the individual
attain that joy which is his right, and that self-development
which should be his highest aim, has
found one of its ablest and most dangerous advocates
in Georg Brandes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<h2>ESAIAS TEGN&Eacute;R</h2>



<p>The genius of the Scandinavian north has
never found a more complete and brilliant
incarnation than the Swedish poet Esaias Tegn&eacute;r.
Strong, cheerful, thoroughly wholesome, with a
boyish delight in prowess, adventure, and daring
deeds, he presents a most agreeable contrast
to the moonshine singers and graveyard bards
of the phosphoristic school, who were his contemporaries.
To Tegn&eacute;r, in his prime, life was a
brisk and exhilarating sail, with a fresh breeze,
over sunny waters; and he had no patience with
those who described it as a painful and troublous
groping through the valley of the shadow of
death. There was, in other words, a certain
charming juvenility in his attitude toward existence,
which presented to him no riddles that a
man with a strong arm and an honest heart might
not solve with comparative ease. All problems
were to him soluble with the sword; and Alexander,
when he cut the Gordian knot, must have
appeared to him wiser, as he was surely more admirable,
than either Plato or Socrates. This scorn
of all metaphysical subtleties, and reliance upon
strength and Swedish manhood, are, perhaps (from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
an advanced European point of view), indicative
of a little intellectual immaturity; but they are
thoroughly characteristic of the Scandinavian nationalities.
The love of brave words and brave
deeds, the exaltation of the man of action above
the man of thought, the pleasure in reckless gallantry
and foolhardy adventure, are, however, not
confined to Swedes and Norwegians, but are characteristic
of the boyhood of every nation. In the
Scotchman, Robert Louis Stevenson, this jaunty
juvenility, this rich enjoyment of bloody buccaneers
and profane sea-dogs, is carried to far greater
lengths, and the great juvenile public of England
and America, both young and old, rises up and
calls him blessed.</p>

<p>There is, however, a vast difference between
Tegn&eacute;r's youthfulness and that of Stevenson. The
latter (in spite of the charm of his style, which is
irresistible) strikes me as a sort of medi&aelig;val survival&mdash;a
boyish feudal sixteenth-century spirit
astray in the nineteenth. I am by no means insensible
to the fascination of his capricious confidences,
his beautiful insight, and his exquisite humor;
but for all that, he always leaves me with a
vague regret at his whimsicality and a certain lack
of robustness in his intellectual equipment. In
Tegn&eacute;r, on the other hand, it is primarily the man
who is impressive; and the author is interesting as
the revelation of the man. He has no literary
airs and graces, but speaks with a splendid authority,
<i>e plena pectore</i>, from the fulness of his manly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span>
conviction. He seems a very personification of the
national genius&mdash;fair, vigorous, and beautiful&mdash;with
the glow of health in his cheeks and the light
of courage in his eye. His vision of the world is
bright and vivid, and he swims with a joyous ease
in the high-tide of the moment, like a beautiful
fish in the luminous summer sea.</p>

<p>As a specimen of magnificent manhood Tegn&eacute;r
had few equals in his day. Tall, robust, and finely
proportioned as he was, with a profile of almost
classic purity, he was equally irresistible to men
and women. There was a breezy, out-of-door air
about him, and a genial straightforwardness and
affability in his manner which took all hearts
captive. His was not only the beauty of perfect
health, but a certain splendid virility in his demeanor
and appearance heightened the charm of
his personality.</p>

<p>It is a matter of wonder that a man in whom the
race-type had reached such perfection was but two
generations removed from the soil. Tegn&eacute;r's grandfathers
on both sides were peasants; and his father,
Esaias Lucasson, was a peasant lad who by industry
and ambition had obtained an education and
become a clergyman. He owed his aristocratic
name to the custom, prevalent in those days, to
Latinize all vulgar appellations. Esaias Lucasson,
of Tegnaby (the little Sm&aring;land village where
he was born), became, in the Latin school, Esaias
Tegnerus. He married in the course of time a
clergyman's daughter, Sara Maria Seidelius, who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
bore him a large family of sons and daughters.
The fifth son, named Esaias after his father, first
saw the light of day in the parsonage of Kyrkerud,
in Wermland, November 13, 1782. When he was
nine years old his father died, leaving behind him
poverty and sorrow. Happily a friend of the family,
the Assessor Branting, took a fancy to the
handsome and clever boy and offered him a home
in his house. Esaias wrote a very clear, good
hand, and soon got a desk and a high three-legged
stool in the assessor's office. So far from
rebelling against this tedious discipline, he applied
himself with zeal to his task, and became, in a short
time, an excellent clerk. And a clerk he might
have remained if his patron had not had the wit to
discover that very unusual talents slumbered in the
lad. Being fond of his society, Mr. Branting got
into the habit of taking him along on his official
journeys; and from the back seat of his chaise
Esaias made the acquaintance of the beautiful
rivers, heights, and valleys of Wermland. The
unconscious impressions which a boy absorbs at
this period of his life are apt to play a decisive
part in fashioning his future. Nature, however
picturesque, never yet made a poet of a dullard;
but many a time has she aroused to poetic consciousness
a soul which without this stimulating
influence might never have discovered its calling,
might never have felt that strange, tremulous exaltation
which demands utterance in song.</p>

<p>Esaias Tegn&eacute;r stored his mind during these<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
journeys with that wealth of imagery, drawn from
the scenery of his native land, which constitutes
the most national element in his verse. He also
contracted, during his residence in Branting's
house, an inordinate love of books. Once during
the harvest-time he was placed on guard at an
open gate, so as to prevent the cattle from breaking
into the adjoining field. To the great chagrin
of his patron, however, the cows made their
way unhindered and unnoticed into the forbidden
territory, while their watchman was lying on his
belly in the grass, deeply absorbed in a book.
Wherever he happened to be, his idea of happiness
was to hide himself away with a cherished volume.
Sometimes he was found sitting on the top
rung of a ladder, sometimes on the roof of a turf-thatched
cottage, oblivious of the world about
him, plunged up to his ears in some historic or
mythological tale. He was voracious, nay, omnivorous,
in his reading. A book was a book to him;
no matter what was its subject, whether it were
poetry, history, heraldry, or horticulture, he was
always likely to find something in it to interest
him. But his favorite reading was the old Norse
sagas, with their tremendous recitals of war and
song and fabulous prowess.</p>

<p>It was not, however, his delight in books which
made the change in his destiny. Professor C. W.
B&ouml;ttiger, Tegn&eacute;r's son-in-law, quotes, in his life of
the poet, the following incident in the latter's own
words:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<p>"One evening, as I was travelling homeward
with Assessor Branting, from Carlstad to H&ouml;gvalta,
the stars were bright and my religious foster-father
seized this opportunity to talk with me about
God's omnipotence, and its visible traces throughout
nature. I had just been reading Bastholm's
'Philosophy for Laymen,' and I began to give an
account of what I had there learned concerning
the movements of the heavenly bodies. This
made an impression upon the old man, who, a
few days later, informed me that he had determined
to give me a scholarly education. This had
long been my secret desire, though I had never
dared to express it. 'You can learn nothing
more with me,' he said, 'and I believe you were
born for something better. If that is the case,' he
added, 'do not forget to thank the Giver of all good
things.'"</p>

<p>The boy, who was now fourteen years old, was
sent to the house of a neighbor, where his elder
brother, Lars Gustaf, was tutor, and was initiated
by him into the classical languages. He also taught
himself English by reading McPherson's "Ossian,"
which kept ringing in his memory for many years
to come. It was during his first enthusiasm for
"Ossian" that, in order to rid himself of the line
"the spear of Connell is keen," he cut it into his
chamber-door, where probably it is yet to be seen.
At the end of fifteen months the elder brother accepted
a more profitable position as tutor in the
family of the great iron-manufacturer Myhrman,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
at R&auml;men, and stipulated that Esaias should be
permitted to accompany him.</p>

<p>Very charming is the description of this hospitable,
patriarchal household, in B&ouml;ttiger's biography;
and doubly interesting it becomes when
we recognize on every page scenes and incidents
which were later woven into "Frithjof's Saga."
There was a large library on the estate, consisting
of French, Latin, and Greek classics. With great
zest Esaias attacked this storehouse of delight;
and scarcely would he grant himself the needed
sleep, because every hour seemed to him lost
which had been robbed from his beloved authors.
The instruction in Latin and Greek which his
brother imparted to the young Myhrmans was to
him far too slow. In his eagerness to plunge into
Homer's enchanted world, he rapidly finished his
grammar, and began to read ahead, book after
book, so as to get the connection, even though understanding
but half the words. Without knowing
it, he had adopted a modern and really most
excellent method of acquiring the language. For
Homer became literature to him instead of a mere
text for excruciating grammatical gymnastics.</p>

<p>It was Tegn&eacute;r's good fortune that his playfellows,
the seven young Myhrmans, were not so fond of
Greek as he was. Often, when he was revelling in
a glorious Homeric passage, these lusty barbarians
would come storming into his room and carry him
off bodily, compelling him to share in their sports;
for Esaias was a capital hand at inventing new<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
games, and they willingly accepted his leadership
and acted upon his suggestions. Particularly his
Homeric games were greatly enjoyed. They divided
their troop into Greeks and Trojans and
captured Troy. Esaias was always Hector, and
the other boys became the raging Ajax, the swift-footed
Achilles, the wily Ulysses, etc. The youngest
daughter of the house, Anna Myhrman, must,
I should fancy, have played somewhat more of a
part in Tegn&eacute;r's boyhood than his biographer allows,
for the descriptions of Frithjof's and Ingeborg's
childhood in Hilding's house are obviously
personal reminiscences:</p>

<p>At the age of seventeen Tegn&eacute;r entered the
University of Lund, accompanied by three young<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
Myhrmans, whose father had generously promised
to share with Assessor Branting the expenses of
his academic education. His playmate, familiarly
called Achilles, had to share his room, and thus
it came to pass that Hector and his deadly foe became
bedfellows. In fact the bed in question,
being intended for but one, afforded the scantiest
possible accommodations for two, and often threatened
to collapse under their united weight. Aching
in every joint from the discomfort of their
cramped position, they would then get up and
spend the remainder of the night in playing
chess.</p>

<p>At the University Tegn&eacute;r soon made his mark,
and two years later took his degree of <i>Magister
Artium</i> with great distinction, being, according
to the extraordinary custom of the country, laurel-crowned
in the cathedral as the first of twenty-four
candidates. The Swede loves pomp and ceremonious
display, and rarely misses an opportunity for
a fine stage effect. I do not mean to insinuate, of
course, that Esaias Tegn&eacute;r was unworthy of the
honor which was conferred upon him; but it
seems a terrible cheapening of the laurel to place
it annually upon the brows of a herd of deedless
striplings, standing upon the threshold of their
careers. Tegn&eacute;r was but nineteen years of age
when the Muse, contrary to her habit, gave him
the crown without the dust, generously rewarding
him in advance of performance. But he came
very near forfeiting the fruits of all his fair fame<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
by participating in a hostile demonstration in front
of the house of the University's rector, who was
justly unpopular. His manly bearing, however,
and the friendship of several of the professors saved
him from the <i>consilium abeundi cum infamia</i>,
with which he was threatened. Instead of that
he was appointed <i>docent</i> in &aelig;sthetics, Secretary to
the Faculty of Philosophy, and Assistant University
Librarian. His summer vacations he spent at
R&auml;men with the Myhrmans. His playmate, Miss
Anna, was now sixteen years of age, and had undergone
that miraculous transformation, which never
loses its delightful mystery, from childhood into
young womanhood. He went away one day and
bade good-by to an awkward kangaroo-like girl in
short skirts, and returned in a few months to greet
a lovely, blushingly dignified young lady, who
probably avowed no more her fondness for him
with the same frank heedlessness as of old. But
she would have been more than woman if she
could have resisted the wooing of the beautiful
youth upon whom nature had showered so many
rare gifts. A stone has been found up in the
woods above R&auml;men which yet shows under its
coating of moss the initials of E. T. and A. M. It
requires but little imagination to fill out the story
of the brief and happy courtship; and two cantos
in "Frithjof's Saga" ("Frithof's Wooing" and
"Frithjof's Happiness") supply an abundance of
hints which have a charmingly autobiographical
tinge:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>

<p>But here, happily, Tegn&eacute;r's life ceased to supply
material for that of his hero. For Anna Myhrman,
instead of pledging her troth to a high-born,
elderly gentleman, like King Ring, married the
young University instructor, Esaias Tegn&eacute;r; and
when her bridal wreath of myrtle failed to arrive
from the city, she twined a wreath of wild heather
instead; and very lovely she looked on her wedding-day
with the modest heather blossoms peeping
forth from under her dark locks.</p>

<p>His insecure position in life, as one dependent
upon the bounty of friends, had hitherto oppressed
Tegn&eacute;r, and at times made him moody and despondent.
He had felt impelled, in justice to himself
and to satisfy the expectations of his patrons,
to apply himself to his studies with a perseverance
and industry which came near undermining
his health. He looked during his student days<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
overworked, and if nature had endowed him with
a less magnificent physique he would, no doubt,
have succumbed to the strain of this perpetual
over-exertion. But after his marriage a happy
change came over him. The joyous substratum of
his nature (what he himself called his pagan self)
broke through its sombre integuments and asserted
itself. No sooner had he taken his place among
the teachers of the University than his clear and
weighty personality commanded admiration and
respect. In social intercourse his ready wit and
cheerful conviviality made him a general favorite.
His talk, without being in the least forced, was
full of surprises; and there was a charm, in the
redundant vigor and virility that seemed to radiate
from him. But it may as well be admitted that
he began at this time to show what may euphemistically
be styled his paganism, in the relish
which he evinced for jests of doubtful propriety.
He was indeed as far as possible from being a
prude; many years later, when he was a bishop
and a great ecclesiastical dignitary, he wrote to his
friend the poet Franz&eacute;n:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I thank God that I can yet, at times, be merry and give
vent to my mirth in prose and verse. I don't scruple to
make a good joke even though its subject be the bridal bed.
All prudery&mdash;and frequently the clerical dignity is, in social
intercourse, nothing else&mdash;I detest and despise."</p></div>

<p>His inability to restrain his wit in this particular
direction has done some injury to his memory.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
Not that his fancy had any taint of uncleanness.
It was open and cheerful as the sunlight; and as
the sunlight played brightly over all things without
fastidious discrimination. There was a rich,
and healthy humanity about him which manifested
itself in an impartial, all-embracing delight in the
glow and color of mere sensuous existence. There
has scarcely ever been a great poet (Dante perhaps
excepted) who has not had his share of this pagan
joy in nudity. Goethe's "Roman Elegies" are undisguisedly
Anacreontic, and the most spiritual of
modern poets, Robert Browning, is as deep and
varied and bountiful in the expression he gives to
life in its sensuous phases as in its highest ascetic
transports.</p>

<p>Do not imagine, then, that I am apologizing for
Tegn&eacute;r, I am merely trying to account for him.
From his Homer, whom he loved above all other
poets, he had in a measure derived that artistic paganism
which perceptibly colored his personality.
There was nothing of the scholarly prig or pedant
about him. In his lectures he gave himself, his
own view of life, and his own interpretation of his
authors. And it was because of the greatness of
the man, the unhackneyed vigor of his speech, and
the power of his intellect that the students flocked
to his lecture-hall and listened with enthusiasm to
his teaching.</p>

<p>I am not by any means sure, however, that
much of his popularity was also due to what, at
this stage of his career, may without disrespect be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
called his immaturity. That wholesome robustness
in his acceptance of life which finds utterance
in his early songs must have established a quick
bond of sympathy between him and his youthful
hearers. The instincts of the predatory man were
yet strong in him. The tribal feeling which we call
patriotism, the juvenile defiance which carries a
chip on its shoulder as a challenge to the world,
the boastful self-assertion which is always ridiculous
in every nation but our own&mdash;impart a splendid
martial resonance to his first notable poem,
"War-Song for the Scanian Reserves" (1808).
There was a charming, frank ferocity in this patriotic
bugle-blast which found an echo in every
Swedish heart. The rapid dactylic metres, with
the captivating rhymes, alternating with the more
contemplative trochees, were admirably adapted
for conveying the ebullient indignation and wrath
which hurls its gauntlet into the face of fate itself,<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a>
checked, as it were, and cooled by soberer reflection
and retrospective regret. It is the sorrow for
the yet recent loss of Finland which inspires the
elegiac tones in Tegn&eacute;r's war-song; and it is his
own ardent, youthful spirit, his own deep and sincere
love of country, which awakes the martial
melody with the throbbing of the drum and the
rousing alarum of trumpets. What can be more
delightfully&mdash;shall I say juvenile&mdash;than this reference<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
to the numerical superiority of the Muscovites:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Many, are they? Well, then, of the many<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Sweden shall drink the red blood and be free!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Many? We count not the warriors' numbers<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Only the fallen shall numbered be."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_28_28" id="Footnote_28_28"></a><a href="#FNanchor_28_28"><span class="label">[28]</span></a></p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Vi Kaste var handske<br /></span>
<span class="i10">Mot &ouml;det sjelf."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>


<p>It is with no desire to disparage Tegn&eacute;r that I
say that this strain, which is that of all his early
war-songs, is extremely becoming to him. It is
not a question of the legitimacy of the sentiment,
but of the fulness and felicity of its expression.
As long as we have wars we must have martial
bards, and with the exception of the German, Theodor
K&ouml;rner, I know none who can bear comparison
with Tegn&eacute;r. English literature can certainly
boast no war-poem which would not be drowned
in the mighty music of Tegn&eacute;r's "Svea," "The
Scanian Reserves," and that magnificent, dithyrambic
declamation, "King Charles, the Young
Hero." Tennyson's "Charge of the Light Brigade"
is technically a finer poem than anything
Tegn&eacute;r has written, but it lacks the deep virile bass,
the tremendous volume of breath and voice, and
the captivating martial lilt which makes the heart
beat willy nilly to the rhythm of the verse.</p>

<p>The popularity which Tegn&eacute;r gained by "The
Scanian Reserves" was the immediate cause of his
appointment to a professorship at the University
of Lund, and his next notable poem, "Svea,"
which won him the great prize of the Swedish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
Academy, raised him to a height of fame which
naturally led to further promotion. According to
the curious custom of Sweden, a professor may,
even though he has never studied theology, take
orders and accept the charge of a parish. He is
regarded as being, by dint of his learning, in the
regular line of clerical promotion; and the elevation
from a professorship (though it be not a theological
one) into a bishopric is no infrequent occurrence.
There was therefore nothing anomalous
in Tegn&eacute;r's appointment (February, 1812) as pastor
of St&auml;fvie and Lackal&auml;nge, and his subsequent
promotion (February, 1824) to the bishopric of
Wexi&ouml;. His pastorate he was permitted to combine
with his professorship of Greek, to which
he was simultaneously transferred from that of
&aelig;sthetics, and the office was chiefly valuable to
him on account of the addition which it procured
him to his income. The nearness of his parish to
Lund enabled him to preach in the country on
Sundays as regularly as he lectured in the city on
week-days. His other pastoral duties he could
not very well discharge <i>in absentia</i>, and they probably
remained in a measure undischarged. He
had not sought the parish; it was the parish which
had sought him; and he exerted himself to the
utmost to fill the less congenial office as conscientiously
as he did his academic chair. The peasants
of St&auml;fvie and Lackal&auml;nge were always welcome at
his hospitable board; he gave them freely his advice,
and in order to recall and emphasize his own<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
kinship with them, he invited a peasant woman to
become the godmother of his youngest son, and
selected all the sponsors from the same class.</p>

<p>This was not the only occasion on which Tegn&eacute;r
demonstrated his superiority to all snobbish pretensions.
He was not only not ashamed of his
peasant descent, but he was proud of it. Once
(1811) during a visit to R&auml;men, he took it into his
head that he desired to know, from actual experience,
the kind of lives which his ancestors must
have lived; and to that end he dressed himself in
wadmal, loaded a dray with pig-iron, greased its
axles, harnessed his team, and drove it to the nearest
city, a distance of ten to twelve miles. He
induced three of his brothers-in-law, two of whom
were army officers and one a government clerk, to
follow his example. Up hill and down hill they
trudged, and arrived late in the afternoon, footsore
and with blistered hands, in the town, where
they reported at the office of a commission merchant,
sold their iron and obtained their receipts.
That of Tegn&eacute;r was made out to Esaias Esaiasson,
which would have been his name, if his father had
never risen from the soil. The four sham peasants
now bought seed-corn with the money they
had obtained for their iron, loaded again their
wagons, and started for home. But they had forgotten
to take into account the robustness of the
rustic appetite, and before they had proceeded far
their bag of provisions was empty. To add to
their discomfort the rain began to pour down, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
they would not seek shelter. After midnight they
arrived at R&auml;men, hungry and drenched, not having
slept for two nights, but happy and proud of
their feat of endurance.</p>

<p>It was in 1811 that Tegn&eacute;r's poem "Svea" received
the prize of the Swedish Academy; and
the fact that it recalled (in single passages at least)
Oehlenschl&auml;ger's "The Golden Horns," does not
seem to have weighed in the verdict. It is not in
any sense an imitation; but there is an audible
reminiscence which is unmistakable in the metre
and cadence of the short-lined verses, descriptive
of the vision. Never, I fancy, had the Swedish
language been made to soar with so strong a wing-beat,
never before had it been made to sing so bold
a melody. To me, I admit, "Svea" is too rhetorical
to make any deep impression. It has a certain
stately academic form, which, as it were, impedes
its respiration and freedom of movement.
When, for all that, I speak of wing-beat and melody,
it must be borne in mind that Sweden had
produced no really great poet<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> before Tegn&eacute;r;
and that thus, relatively considered, the statement
is true. But Tegn&eacute;r seems himself to have been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
conscious of the strait-jacket in which the old
academic rules confined him, for in the middle of
the poem he suddenly discards the stilted Alexandrines
with which he had commenced and breaks
into a rapturous old-Norse chant, the abrupt metres
of which recall the <i>fornyrdhalag</i> of the Elder Edda.
Soon after "Svea" followed, in 1812, "The
Priestly Consecration," the occasion of which was
the poet's own ordination. Here the oratorical
note and a certain clerical rotundity of utterance
come very near spoiling the melody. "At the
Jubilee in Lund" (1817) is very much in the same
strain, and begins with the statement so characteristic
of Tegn&eacute;r:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Thou who didst the brave twin stars enkindle,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Reason and Religion, guard the twain!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each shines by other; else they fade and dwindle.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i1">Fill with clearness every human brain:<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Faith and hope in every bosom reign!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_29_29" id="Footnote_29_29"></a><a href="#FNanchor_29_29"><span class="label">[29]</span></a> Carl Michael Bellman, the Swedish B&eacute;ranger (1740-1795),
whose wanton music resounded through the latter half of the
eighteenth century, would, no doubt, by many be called a great
poet. But his Bacchanalian strain, though at times exquisite and
captivating, lacks the universality of sentiment and that depth of
resonance of which greatness can alone be predicated. Both his
wild mirth and his sombre melancholy exhale the aroma of ardent
spirits.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_30_30" id="Footnote_30_30"></a><a href="#FNanchor_30_30"><span class="label">[30]</span></a> This line reads literally: "Guard them both; they are willingly
reconciled."</p></div>

<p>He was, in fact, never very orthodox; and if he
had belonged to the American branch of his denomination
would surely have been tried for heresy.
Rarely has a deadlier foe of priestly obscurantism
and medi&aelig;val mysteries worn the episcopal
robes. With doctrinal subtleties and ingenious
hair-splitting he had no patience; conduct was
with him the main, if not the only, thing to be
considered. The Christian Church, as he conceived<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
it, was primarily a civilizer, and the expression
of the highest ethical sentiment of the age.</p>

<p>"The Church," he writes, "can surely not be
re-established in its former religious significance,
for the system upon which it rests has slept away
three centuries of history; and it is of no use that
this man or that man yet pretends to believe in
the somnambulist. But the church has also a
civic significance as an integral part of the social
order of humanity. If you abandon that to the
spirit of laxity and drowsiness, I can see no reason
why the clergy and the whole religious apparatus
should not be, and ought not to be, abolished and
their costs covered into the treasury."</p>

<p>These are not highly episcopal sentiments; but
they are in keeping with Tegn&eacute;r's whole personality
and his conception of his duty. His first
concern was to purge his diocese of drunken clergymen,
a task in which he encountered many unforeseen
difficulties.</p>

<p>"It is nowadays less difficult," he says, "to get
rid of a king than a drunken clergyman."</p>

<p>He was, indeed, very moderate in his demands,
stipulating only that no shepherd of souls should
show himself drunk in public. But the bibulous
parsons frequently had influential relatives, who
exerted themselves with the government to thwart
the bishop's reformatory schemes. If Tegn&eacute;r had
not been the masterful, tireless, energetic prelate
that he was, his ardor would have cooled; and
he would have contented himself with drawing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
the revenues of his office, and left with the lukewarm
government the responsibility for frustrating
his purposes. But this was contrary to his
nature. He could not calmly contemplate abuses
which it was his duty to remedy; and no discouragement
ever sufficed to dampen his noble zeal.
The marked and fanatical pietism which then was
much diffused among the Sm&aring;land peasantry he
fought with his cheerful gospel of reason and sanity.
Just as poetry to him meant the highest
bloom of life, and his radiant lyre resounded with
noble music like the statue of Memnon, when
touched by the rays of the dawn; so religion was,
in its essence, perfect sanity of soul, a beautiful
equilibrium of mind, and complete self-mastery.
His Christ was not primarily the bleeding, the
scourged, the crucified, but rather a benigner and
lovelier Ph&oelig;bus Apollo, the bringer of clearness
and light, the dispeller of the unwholesome mists
and barbaric gloom that yet brood over the human
soul. Like Goethe, he cherished a veritable abhorrence
of the mystic symbolism of the medi&aelig;val
church; and was rather inclined to minimize the
significance of Christ's death and passion. He had
undeniably imparted into his Christianity a great
deal of sunny Hellenic paganism&mdash;a fact which
in his familiar correspondence with Franz&eacute;n he
scarcely cares to disguise.</p>

<p>Having this conception of the episcopal office,
he could not escape emphasizing his function as
the supervisor of the schools of his diocese. If he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
was to be a civilizer on any great scale, the chance
which was here afforded him to impress his ideals
upon the rising generation was not one to be neglected.
And, as a matter of fact, Tegn&eacute;r was indefatigable
in his labors as an educator. His
many speeches at school celebrations preached, as
ever, a gospel derived from Greece rather than
Jud&aelig;a; and half-improvised though some of them
appear to be, they contain passages of lofty eloquence.</p>

<p>It was inevitable that a bishop of such commanding
personality, who wielded his authority at
times somewhat ruthlessly, should make enemies.
But, on the other hand, the beautiful beneficence
and sincere humanity of the man often obliterated
the ill-feeling which his official severity
had aroused. To the widows of deceased clergymen
in his diocese he was a veritable guardian, to
their children a father, to his peasantry a friend,
adviser, and monitor. He was an expert at detecting
errors in ecclesiastical balance-sheets; and
woe to the cleric who dared present to him inaccurate
accounts of income and expenditures. By
sheer dint of his personal superiority and that
quality of soul which George Eliot calls dynamic,
he impressed himself strongly upon all with whom
he came in contact; and though he was feared, he
was also beloved as few. A very delightful instance
of the reverence with which he was regarded
is recorded by B&ouml;ttiger.</p>

<p>One summer evening he arrived at a remote<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
parsonage which had never, in the memory of
man, been visited by a bishop. Some time after
his arrival Tegn&eacute;r observed two young ladies, the
daughters of the house, coming across the yard
carrying between them a big tub, full of water.
When he asked them, in a friendly way, why they
subjected themselves to such hard labor, one of
them replied: "Should we not regard it as an
honor to be allowed to water the bishop's horses?"</p>

<p>In order to give a clear and coherent idea of
Tegn&eacute;r in his prime, I have been obliged to
anticipate events. Many literary achievements
which I have left unrecorded belong to the period
previous to his assumption of the bishopric of
Wexi&ouml;. Unhappily Professor B&ouml;ttiger's edition is
very chary of dates, and as Dr. Brandes has truly
observed, is arranged with the obvious purpose of
falsifying the sequence of Tegn&eacute;r's poems and confusing
the reader. The three periods&mdash;previous to
1812, 1812-40, and 1840-46&mdash;are entirely arbitrary,
and plainly devised with a view to concealing, in so
far as they are capable of concealment, the unhappy
events which undermined the strength of
the Titan and wrecked his splendid powers. But
such a purpose is utterly futile, as long as the
poems themselves had once escaped into publicity.</p>

<p>It was during the period while his sky was yet
unclouded that Tegn&eacute;r enriched Swedish literature
with a series of lyrics which in point of lucidity of
thought and brilliancy of diction have rarely been
surpassed. It may be admitted, without materially<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
detracting from his merit, that in some of them
the foreign models from which they were in a
measure fashioned shimmer through. Just as the
Germans, Gottsched and Bodmer, held foreign
models to be indispensable, and only disagreed as
to which were the best, so the Swedish Academy,
which in its predilections was French, had no
scruple in recommending this or that literary form
for imitation. That degree of literary independence
which Germany reached with Goethe and
Schiller, who discarded all models, the Scandinavian
countries did not reach until a much later
period; and Tegn&eacute;r was one of those who stimulated
that national self-respect without which
independence is impossible.</p>

<p>A strong spiritual kinship drew him to Schiller,
whose splendor of imagery and impassioned rhetoric
were the very gifts which he himself in a superlative
degree possessed. The breath of political
and religious liberalism which pervades the
writings of the German poet was also highly congenial
to Tegn&eacute;r, and last, but not least, they were
both light-loving, beauty-worshipping Hellenists,
and, though externally conformists, hid joyous pagan
souls under imperfect Christian draperies.
Small blame it is therefore to Tegn&eacute;r that Schiller's
poems furnished him with frequent suggestions
and sometimes also with metres. Schiller
had, in "The Gods of Greece," sung a glorious
elegy on the Olympian age which stimulated his
Swedish rival to write "The Asa Age," in which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>
he regretted, though in a rather half-hearted way,
the disappearance of Odin, Thor, and Freya.
The poem, it must be admitted, falls much below
Tegn&eacute;r at his best. Schiller's "Three Words of
Faith," in which liberty, virtue, and God are declared
to be the only essentials of religion, finds a
parallel (which even retains the metre) in Tegn&eacute;r's
"The Eternal," in which truth, justice, and beauty
are substituted. A kindred poetic creed is far
more consciously proclaimed in the famous poem
<i>Sangen</i> (Poetry), which was primarily a protest
against the gloomy and morbid view of poetry
entertained by the Swedish Romanticists (the so-called
Phosphorists). Tegn&eacute;r here declares that
the poet "with heavenly joy embraces life," that
"he knows no weak lament" (at its misery), "no
dissonance which is not dissolved" (in harmony).
His temple stands in light and flame; and at its
base a fountain gurgles, a draught from which is
an elixir of strength and a panacea for all ills.</p>

<p>"Well, then," he continues, "from this fountain
will I drink, if I am worthy of such a draught.
With healthy eyes will I look about me in the sick
world. My golden lyre shall not resound with
sorrows which I myself have invented. For the
poet's sorrows are none; and the sky of song is
forever bright."</p>

<p>Peter Amadeus Atterbom, the leader of the
Phosphorists, replied with much moderation and
good sense to the obvious reflections upon his
school which this poem contained. He intimates<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
plainly enough that Tegn&eacute;r's philosophy of life, in
so far as it ignores sin and sorrow, which are too
real to be banished by song, is a hopelessly shallow
one.</p>

<p>"The undissolved dissonances," he says, "in
the sense in which Mr. Tegn&eacute;r uses the expression,
certainly betray a disease of the soul, but
this disease is not peculiar to a temperament which
is fostered by a personal emotional affinity for lugubrious
topics and ideas given by birth and developed
by circumstances; but it is inherent in
the weakness (which at times doubtless surprises
even the strongest ...) of desiring to set
up its sorrowful view of the world as a theory, and
treat it as absolutely true and fundamentally valid
for all. Sorrow, as such, is no more a diseased
state than is joy; both are alike primordial, necessary,
indispensable elements and halves of human
life. Who would venture to assert that the day
might dispense with the night? And does not
the latter's glorious starry sky rival in majesty
(though different in kind) the former's bright and
dazzling blitheness?"</p>

<p>The fact was that Tegn&eacute;r's cheery sun-worship
was as much temperamental as was Atterbom's
sentimental reveries and nocturnal melancholy.
The Phosphorist is unquestionably right,
however, in asserting that as a theory of life the
one is as limited and imperfect as the other. It
was because of the abhorrence of all the darker
phases of existence that Tegn&eacute;r's bright Hellenic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
muse never struck those notes which thrill
with deepest resonance through the human heart.
Tegn&eacute;r's acquaintance with suffering during the
early part of his career was chiefly a literary one,
and like Goethe he went far out of his way to
avoid the sight of it. As there can be no victory
without combat&mdash;no laurel without dust&mdash;the
Mount of Transfiguration is not reached except
through the valley of the Shadow of Death.</p>

<p>There are, however, many fair flowers to be
plucked in Tempe and the blooming vales of Arcady.
Goethe had in 1798 published "Hermann
and Dorothea," the form of which was Greek,
though the theme was Teutonic; and Tegn&eacute;r's
"Children of the Lord's Supper" (1820), which
Longfellow has translated so admirably into English,
derived its inspiration primarily from the
German idyl:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Pentecost, day of rejoicing, had come, the church of the village<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood, gleaming white in the morning sheen. On the spire of the belfry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Decked with a brazen cock, the friendly flames of the spring sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glanced like the tongues of fire beheld by Apostles aforetime."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Thus run the beautiful, stately hexameters, which,
whatever cavilling critics may say, are delightfully
adapted for epic narrative in any fairly polysyllabic
language. And Swedish, which is the most
sonorous of all Germanic tongues, and full of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
Gothic strength, produces the most delectable effects
in the long, rolling line of slow-marching
dactyls and spondees. The tempered realism of
Tegn&eacute;r, which shuns all that is harsh and trite, accords
well with the noble classical verse. He employs
it, as it were, to dignify his homely tale, as
Raphael draped the fishermen of Galilee in the
flowing robes of Greek philosophers. The description
of the church, the rustic youth, and the
patriarchal clergyman has, however, the note of
experience and the touch of earth which we miss
in the more declamatory passages. If, however,
declamation is anywhere in place it is in the three
orations of the rural parson, which occupy the
larger portion of the poem. It is all very lovely
and edifying; full of sacred eloquence and a grand
amplitude of phrase which is distinctly clerical.</p>

<p>The romantic tale of "Axel" (1822), modelled
after Byron's narrative poems, rejoiced in a greater
popularity, in spite of the carping criticism with
which it was received by the <i>Svensk Litteratur-Tidning,</i>
the organ of the Phosphorists. Though,
to be sure, the merits of the poem are largely ignored
in this review, it is undeniable that the
faults which are emphasized do exist. First, the
frequent violations of probability (which, by the
way, ought not to have been so offensive to a romanticist)
draw tremendous draughts upon the
reader's credulity; and secondly, the lavish magnificence
of imagery rarely adds to the vividness of
the situations, but rather obscures and confuses<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
them. It reminds one of a certain style of barocque
architecture in which the rage for ornamentation
twists every line into a scroll or spiral or arabesque,
until whatever design there originally was is lost
in a riot of decoration. The metaphors exist for
their own sake, and are in nowise subordinate to
the themes which they profess to illustrate. Take,
for instance, the oft-quoted passage:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The night drew near, and in the west<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon its couch lay Evening dreaming,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And silent, like the priests of Egypt,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stars pursued their radiant paths,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And earth stood in the starry eve,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As blissful as a bride who stands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The garland in her dusky hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath the baldaquin and blushes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tired of the games of day, and warm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Na&iuml;ad rested, still and smiling,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The glow of evening shone resplendent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A gorgeous rose upon her breast;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And merry Cupid, who had slept<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When sun was high, awoke and rode<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon the moonbeams up and down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With bow and arrow, through the forest."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This is all very magnificent; but the images
tread so close upon each other's heels, that they
come near treading each other down, and tumbling
together in a confused jumble. I claim no originality
in calling attention to the fact that it must
have been a colossal Na&iuml;ad who could wear the
evening glow like "a gorgeous rose upon her
breast." Likewise former critics have questioned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
whether the stars gain in the least in vividness
by being compared to the priests of Egypt,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> who
were certainly far less familiar to the reader's
vision.</p>

<p>The story of the Swedish officer Axel and his
beloved, the Cossack Amazon, Maria, has from beginning
to end a flavor of Byron, and recalls alternately
"the Corsair" and "Lara." The extravagant
sentimentality of the tale appealed, however,
powerfully to the contemporary taste, and the dissenting
voice of criticism was drowned like the
shrill note of a single fife in the noisy orchestra
of praise. The Swedish matrons and maidens
wept over Axel's and Maria's heroic, but tragic
love, as those of England, nay, of all Europe, wept
over that of Conrad and Medora. Maria, when
she hears that Axel has a betrothed at home, enlists
as a man in the Russian army (a very odd proceeding
by the way, and scarcely conducive to her
purpose) and resolves to kill her rival. She is,
however, mortally wounded, and Axel finds her dying
upon the battlefield.</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_32_32" id="Footnote_32_32"></a><a href="#FNanchor_32_32"><span class="label">[32]</span></a> The original is in the rhymed Byronic metre, mostly in couplets.
In order not to sacrifice anything of the meaning I have
chosen to put it into blank verse.</p></div>

<p>This is exactly the Byronic note, which would
be still more audible, if I had preserved the
rhymed couplets. Even Medora's male attire is
borrowed by Maria, and much more of this Byronic
melodramatic heroism is there, only a little
more conventionally draped and with larger
concessions to the Philistine sense of propriety.
But even if Tegn&eacute;r in "Axel" had coquetted with
the Romantic muse, it would be rash to conclude
that he contemplated any durable relation. The
note which he had struck in his renowned oration
at the festival commemorating the Reformation
(1817), came from the depth of his heart, and continued
to resound through his speech and song for
many years to come. I do not moan to imply, of
course, that the Byronic Romanticism was very
closely akin to that of Tieck, the Schlegels, and
Novalis; or that Tegn&eacute;r in the least compromised
his frank and manly liberalism by composing a
variation, as it were, on a Byronic theme. How
deeply he hated the medi&aelig;val obscurantism which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
then, under the auspices of Metternich and his
unholy "Holy Alliance" was spreading over Europe,
he showed in numerous private and public
utterances concerning the political condition of
Europe after the fall of Napoleon. His greeting
to the "New Year, 1816" (which his son-in-law
has foolishly excluded from his edition of the collected
works), is overbrimming with bitterness at
the triumph of the enemies of the light.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>It was the fashion in those days to revile the
Revolution, because it had produced the man on
horseback who had turned the old order of things
topsy-turvy in a very unceremonious fashion.
Coleridge, Southey, and Wordsworth in England,
and Klopstock, Schiller, and a horde of lesser lights
in Germany, had hailed the French uprising as the
bloody dawn of a new and more glorious day; but
the excesses of the Reign of Terror frightened<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
them back into the old fastnesses of Conservatism.
Tegn&eacute;r (and to his honor be it said) was one of
the few who did not despair of liberty because a
people born and bred in despotism failed to exercise
the wisdom and self-restraint which only liberty
can foster. For the only road to the attainment
of liberty is its practice and its abuse, and the
slow education which can be acquired by no theoretical
teaching, but only in the hard and expensive
school of experience. For the terrible birth-pangs
of liberty no despotically governed people can escape,
unless it chooses to remain in thraldom.</p>

<p>This is the spirit that breathes through Tegn&eacute;r's
speeches and poems, during his most vigorous manhood;
and even, when the rift in his lute made
its music harsh and uncertain, the strain was yet essentially
the same, though transposed into an alien
key. It is very tempting to quote the many noble
sayings of this master of the commanding phrase,
but one or two must suffice. It is a delight to
read his published correspondence, because of this
power of strong and luminous utterance, which he
wields with such Titanic ease. Then, again, there
is no affectation or cant, but an engaging candor
and straightforwardness which bespeak a true man,
considering the time when they were written.
What clarity of political vision there is in such
passages as these:</p>

<p>(1813.) "He who fancies that Europe will be
delivered by Russia and her confederates, or that
the progress of the Cossacks is for the advantage<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
of Sweden, may perhaps be in the right; but his
views are very different from mine. In the hatred
of the Barbarians I am born and bred, and I hope
to die in it, unbewildered by modern sophisms."</p>

<p>(1814.) "Who can believe in the re-establishment
of the European balance of power or rejoice
in the victory of wretched mediocrity over power
and genius. The upheavals of the age will soon
affect us all&mdash;at least us Swedes."</p>

quaking from the French Revolution is undeniable;
and extremely foolish seems to me the speech
of those who insist that the Revolution is finished,
or even approaching its end."</p>

<p>Living as he did in an age of general disillusion,
Tegn&eacute;r performed an important service in endeavoring
to stem with the full force of his personality
the rising tide of reaction. How much he accomplished
in this direction is difficult to estimate, for
we can never know what turn Swedish affairs might
have taken, if his clarion voice had not been heard.
But it could scarcely fail that such a speech as the
one at the Festival of the Reformation (1817),
delivered in the presence of a large assembly of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>
scholars and public men, must have made a great
impression, and in a hundred direct and indirect
ways affected public opinion. Luther is to Tegn&eacute;r
a hero of liberty, a breaker of human shackles, a
deliverer from spiritual bondage and gloom.</p>

<p>"Luther was one of those rare historical characters
who always, in whatever they undertake,
by their very manner, surprise, and indelibly impress
themselves upon the memory. There was
something chivalrous, I could almost say adventurous,
in his whole personality, in his whole way
of beginning and prosecuting an enterprise. He
put upon whatever he did the stamp of an almost
inconceivable greatness&mdash;of an almost overwhelming
force. His mere word was half a battle, his
deed was a whole one. He was one of those mighty
souls which, like certain trees, can only bloom in
a storm. His whole great, rich, marvellous life
has always seemed to me like an epic with its battles
and its final victory. Such a spirit must of
necessity make room for itself, and decisively assert
itself in history, in whatever direction its activity
may be turned, under whatever circumstances and
at whatever time it enters upon its career. The
time when Luther came was one of those great historical
epochs when the world-serpent sheds its
skin and reappears in rejuvenated shape....
A great man, even the very greatest, is always the
son of his age&mdash;only he is the eldest son; he is the
deputy and executor of the age. The age is his,
and he administers its substance according to his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
judgment. He finds the scattered elements to his
hand, but usually tangled up and struggling in
chaotic disorder. To gather and arrange them into
a creation, to direct them toward a definite goal, ...
this is his greatness; this is his creative
powers.... In this ... sense Luther
created his age."<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a></p>

<p>Dr. Brandes has anticipated me in calling attention
to the fact that the orator's characterization
of Luther, though highly interesting, is one-sided.
But as his admirable monograph on Tegn&eacute;r is not
accessible to English readers, I feel justified in repeating
his argument in abbreviated form. There
is a great uniformity, he says, in substance, in all
Tegn&eacute;r's heroes. They are all men of action&mdash;bold,
strong, adventurous heroes, such as boys delight in.
They have a striking family resemblance. With
the change of a few attributes Tegn&eacute;r applies his
characterization of Luther to such a widely differing
personality as King Gustavus III. of Sweden,
a frivolous, theatrical, Frenchified, infidel monarch.
And Gustavus Adolphus and Charles XII. are
forced into the same livery, in spite of their diversity
of structure, because Tegn&eacute;r admired them all,
and had practically but one type which appeared
to his frank, open, and somewhat boyish fancy
wholly worthy of admiration.<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a></p>

<p>In reading consecutively the whole series of Tegn&eacute;r's
collected works I am much struck with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>
force of this criticism. The brave man who defies
the world single-handed, and plunges up to his ears
into dangers, without counting the odds against
him, is the typical juvenile hero; and it is strange,
though by no means incomprehensible, that a man
like Tegn&eacute;r, who could betray such political insight
as is shown in his letters to Franz&eacute;n and Leopold
had not really gotten beyond this primitive type of
excellence. In a certain sense, perhaps, it was not
desirable that he should. For the tremendous
popularity which greeted "Frithjof's Saga" was
due in no small measure to this half-juvenile
robustness of its author's genius. As I cannot
help regretting in myself the loss of my boyish
appetite for swashbuckling marauders, and mysterious
treasure-diggers, I am, indeed, far from
deploring Tegn&eacute;r's delight in the insane prowess of
Charles XII., or the gay and chivalrous gallantry
of Gustavus III. There is a sort of fine salubriousness
in it which makes one, on the whole, like
him the more.</p>

<p>It might well be said of Tegn&eacute;r, as he said of
Luther, that his word was half a battle. At all
events he accomplished by his speeches a complete
overthrow of his opponents the Phosphorists, without
engaging in the barren polemics to which they
invited him. He waited until some appropriate
public occasion occurred, and then spoke out of
the fulness of his conviction. And his words
spread like undulating waves of light from one
end of the land to the other, finding lodgement in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
thousands of hearts. Thus his beautiful epilogue at
the "magister promotion"<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> in Lund (1820) was a
direct manifesto (and a most incisive one) against
that mystic obscurity which, according to the
Phosphorists, was inseparable from the highest
and deepest poetic utterance:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"In vain they call upon the lofty Truth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With sombre conjurations; for the dark<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She ne'er endures; for her abode is light.<br /></span>

<p>This was certainly an attractive doctrine, and it
did not fail to command public approval. But it
suffers from exactly the same limitation as Tegn&eacute;r's
gospel of joy. It is only relatively (I might
almost say temperamentally) true; and the opposite
might be maintained with equal force, and
in fact was so maintained by Atterbom, who declared
(in the "Poetical Calendar for 1821") that
there can be no such a conception as light without
darkness. Darkness, he says, is the condition of all
color and form. You distinguish the light and all
things in it only by the contrasting effect of shadow&mdash;all
of which, I fancy, Tegn&eacute;r would not have
denied. More to the point would have been the
query whether in poetry darkness and indistinctness
are synonymous terms. It is only the most
commonplace truths which can be made intelligible
to all. Much of the best and highest thinking
of humanity lies above the plane of the ordinary
untrained intellect. What is light to me may be
twilight or darkness to you. What to you is clear
as the daylight, may to me be as densely impenetrable
as the Cimmerian night. Christ himself
recognized this fact when he said to his disciples:
"I have yet many things to say unto you, but ye
cannot bear them now."</p>

<p>For all that, Tegn&eacute;r's doctrine was in its effect
wholesome. It discouraged the writers of the
Romantic School, who under the guise of profundity
gave publicity to much immature and confused
thinking. He was no doubt right in saying that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
"a poetry which commences with whooping-cough
is likely to end in consumption." His frequently
repeated maxim, that poetry is nothing but the
health of life, "occasioned by an abounding intellectual
vigor, a joyous leap over the barriers of
everyday life," applied, however, to his own poetry
only so long as his vigor was unimpaired. His
terrible poem "Hypochondria" (<i>Mjeltsjukan</i>) is
to me no less poetical because it is not "a petrified
drop of heavenly light," and mocks all the cheerful
theories of its author's prime.</p>

<p>Tegn&eacute;r had yet a few years in which to rejoice
in this "health of life" in which he found the inspiration
for his song; and these last years were
the most fruitful in his entire career. He was
about forty years of age when, in 1820, he began
to compose the first cantos of "Frithjof's Saga."
He was living in modest comfort, happy in his
marital relation, and surrounded by a family of
children to whom he was a most affectionate
father. He could romp and play with his curly-headed
boys and girls without any loss of dignity;
and they loved nothing better than to invade his
study. Next to them in his regard was a black-nosed
pug, named Atis, who invariably accompanied
him to his lectures and remained sitting at
his feet listening with intelligent gravity to his
explanations of the Greek poets. If by chance his
master, in his zeal for his own poetry, forgot the
lecture-hour, Atis would respectfully pull him by
the tails of his coat. No man at the University of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
Lund was more generally beloved than Tegn&eacute;r,
and all honors which the University could bestow
had been offered to him. The office of Rector
Magnificus he had, however, persisted in declining.</p>

<p>There was at that time a general revival of interest
in the so-called saga-age. The Danish poet,
Oehlenschl&auml;ger, had published his old-Norse cycle
of poems, "Helge," which aroused a sympathetic
reverberation in Tegn&eacute;r's mind. The idea took
possession of him that here was a theme which
lay well within the range of his own voice, and full
of alluring possibilities. Accordingly he chose
the ancient "Saga of Frithjof the Bold," and resolved
to embody in it all the characteristic features
of the old heroic life. And what Oehlenschl&auml;ger
had attempted to do, and partly succeeded
in doing, he accomplished with a completeness of
success which was a surprise to himself. No sooner
had "Iduna," the organ of the Gothic League,
published the first nine cantos (1821), than all
Sweden resounded with enthusiastic applause; and
even from beyond the boundaries of the fatherland
came voices of praise. When the completed poem
appeared in book-form, it was translated into all
civilized languages, and everywhere, in spite of the
translators' shortcomings, it was hailed with delight.
Not only England, France, and Germany
hastened to appropriate it, but even in Spain,
Greece, and Russia tears were shed over "Ingeborg's
Lament," and tender bosoms palpitated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
with sympathy for Frithjof's sorrows. I know a
dozen English translations of "Frithjof's Saga"
(a friend of mine, who is a bibliophile, assures me
that the exact number is at present twenty-one),
and of German versions the number is not very
much less. A Norwegian (or rather Danish) rendering
was presented to me on my twelfth birthday;
and the sentiment which then most forcibly
appealed to me was, as I vividly remember, embodied
in the following verse, in which Bj&ouml;rn
chides his friend's grief for the loss of his beloved:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Frithjof, 'tis time for your folly's abating;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sigh and lament for a woman's loss:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Earth is, alas, too full of such dross;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One may be lost, still a thousand are waiting.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Say but the word, of such goods I will bring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quickly a cargo&mdash;the Southland can spare them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bed as the rose, mild as lambs in the spring;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then we'll cast lots, or as brothers we'll share them."<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_37_37" id="Footnote_37_37"></a><a href="#FNanchor_37_37"><span class="label">[37]</span></a> Holcomb's translation.</p></div>

<p>It was not the unconscious humor of this proposition
which struck me the most in those days;
but it was the bluff frankness of the gruff old viking
which then seemed truly admirable. In fact,
I am not sure but that Bj&ouml;rn appeared to me a
more sympathetic figure than Frithjof. But a little
later it dawned upon me that his utter lack
of chivalry was rather revolting; and I began to
marvel at my former admiration. At fourteen the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
following verse (which at twelve was charmingly
heroic) caused me to revise my opinion of Bj&ouml;rn:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Good! to King Ring it shall be my glad duty<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Something to teach of a wronged viking's power;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fire we his palace at midnight's still hour,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scorch the old graybeard and bear off the beauty."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>For all that, Bj&ouml;rn with his rough speech and
hearty delight in fighting and drinking, is far truer
to the spirit of the old heroic age than is Frithjof
with his sentimentality and lovesick reveries.
This verse, for instance, is replete with the briny
breath of the northern main. The north wind
blows through it:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Good is the sea, your complaining you squander,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Freedom and joy on the sea flourish best.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He never knoweth effeminate rest<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who on the billows delighteth to wander.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I am old, to the green-growing land<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I, too, will cling, with the grass for my pillow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now I will drink and will fight with free hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now I'll enjoy my own sorrow-free billow."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I might continue in the autobiographical vein;
but must forbear. For there is a period in the
life of every young Norseman when, untroubled by
its anachronism, he glories in Frithjof's melancholy
mooning, his praise of Ingeborg, his misanthropy,
and all the manifold moods of love so
enchantingly expressed in Tegn&eacute;r's melodious
verse.</p>

<p>When a book acquires this significance as an expression<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
of the typical experience in the lives of
thousands, the critical muse can but join in the
general chorus, and find profound reasons for the
universal praise. In the case of "Frithjof's Saga"
this is not a difficult matter. From beginning to
end the poem has a lyrical intensity which sets the
mind vibrating with a responsive emotion. It is
not a coldly impersonal epic, recounting remote
heroic events; but there is a deeply personal note
in it, which has that nameless moving quality&mdash;<i>la
note &eacute;mue</i>, as the French call it&mdash;which brings
the tear to your eye, and sends a delicious breeze
through your nerves. All that, to be sure, or
nearly all of it, evaporates in translation; for no
more than you can transfer the exquisite dewy intactness
of the lily to canvas can you transfer the
rapturous melody of noble verse into an alien
tongue. The subtlest harmonies&mdash;those upon
which the thrill depends&mdash;are invariably lost. If
Longfellow, instead of giving us two cantos, had
translated the whole poem, we should, at least,
have possessed an English version which would
have afforded us some conception of the charm of
the renowned original.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span></p><p>The objections to "Frithjof's Saga" which
have been urged by numerous critics may all be
admitted as more or less valid; yet something remains
which will account for its astounding popularity.
Tegn&eacute;r at the time when he was singing
of Frithjof's and Ingeborg's love was himself suffering
from a consuming but unrequited passion.
The strong, warm pulse of life which throbs in
Frithjof's wrath, defiance, and scorn, and in his
deep and manly tenderness is the poet's own. It
marks but the rhythm of his own tumultuous
heart-beat. It is altogether an unhappy chapter,
which his biographer has vainly striven to suppress.
There was among his acquaintance in
Lund a certain Mrs. Palm, toward whom he felt
drawn with an irresistible half-demonic force.
Beyond this fact we know nothing of the lady,
except that she was handsome, cultivated, and
well-connected. Whatever approaches Tegn&eacute;r
may have made toward her (and it is not known
of what nature they were) she appears to have repelled;
and the poet, though fighting desperately
against his growing infatuation, wore out his
splendid vitality in the conflict of emotions which
the unhappy relation occasioned. He became a
prey to the most terrible melancholy, and a misanthropy
of the deepest hue spread its sombre veil
over the world which hitherto had given to him
its brightest smile. The dread of insanity became
an <i>id&eacute;e fixe</i> with him; and the pathetic cry,
"God preserve my reason," rings again and again
through his private correspondence. One of his
brothers was insane; and he fancied that there
must be a taint in his blood which menaced him
with the same tragic doom.</p>

<p>Happily, he could as yet conjure the storm. It
hung threateningly on the horizon of his mind,
with mutterings of thunder and stray flashes of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
lightning. But his poetic bark still sped along
with full sails, bravely breasting the waves.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Und wenn der Mensch in seiner Qual verstummt<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gab mir ein Gott zu sagen was ich leide,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>says Goethe. And this divine gift of saying, or,
better still, of singing, what he suffered made Tegn&eacute;r,
during this period, master of his sufferings.
They did not overwhelm him and ruin his usefulness.
On the contrary, these were the most active
and fruitful years of his life. But it was the deep
agitation which possessed him&mdash;it was the suppressed
tumult of his strong soul which vibrated
through "Frithjof" and which imparted to it that
vital quality, that moving ring which arouses the
deeper feelings in the human heart.</p>

<p>Arch&aelig;ologically the poem was not correct, and
was not meant to be. Tegn&eacute;r distinctly disclaimed
the intention of producing a historically
accurate picture of the saga age; and all criticism
censuring the modernness of Frithjofs and Ingeborg's
sentiments is, therefore, according to his
idea, wide of the mark. I do not quite agree with
his point of view, but will state his argument.
For the historical Frithjof, as he is represented in
the ancient Norse saga bearing his name, Tegn&eacute;r
cared but little. What he wished to do was to
give a poetic presentation of the old heroic life,
and he chose Frithjof as his representative of this
age because he united in himself so many of its
characteristics:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"In the saga much occurs which is very grand and heroic,
and hence valid for all times, which both might and
ought to be retained; but, on the other hand, a great deal
occurs which is rough, savage, barbarous; and this had
either to be entirely eliminated, or at least materially softened.
Up to a certain degree it therefore became necessary
to modernize; but the difficulty was to find the golden
mean. On the one hand, the poem ought not to offend too
much our more refined manners and gentler modes of
thought; but, on the other hand, the natural quality, the
freshness, the truth to nature ought not to be sacrificed."</p></div>

<p>Tegn&eacute;r fancies he has solved this problem by
retaining in Frithjof the fundamental traits of
all heroism, viz., nobility, magnanimity, courage;
but at the same time nationalizing them by giving
them a distinctly Scandinavian tinge. And this
he has done by making his hero almost wantonly
defiant, stubborn, pugnacious. As Ingeborg, lamenting
his fierce pugnacity, and yet glorying in
it, says:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"How glad, how stubborn, and how full of hope!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The point he setteth of his trusty sword<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Against the breast of Fate and crieth, Thou must yield."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Another peculiarity of the Norseman's character is a
certain tendency to sadness and melancholy which is habitual
with all deeper natures. An elegiac tone pervades all
our old national melodies, and, generally speaking, all that
is of significance in our history; for it rises from the very
bottom of the nation's heart. There is a certain joyousness
(commonly attributed to the French) which in the last instance
is only levity. But the joyousness of the North is
fundamentally serious; for which reason I have in Frithjof<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
endeavored to give a hint of this brooding melancholy in
his repentance of the unintentional burning of the temple,
his brooding fear of Balder,</p></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Who sits in the sky, and the thoughts he sends down,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which forever are clouding my mind."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It will be seen from this that Tegn&eacute;r was fully
conscious of what he was doing. He civilized
Frithjof, because he was addressing a civilized
audience which would have taken little interest in
the rude viking of the eighth century, if he had
been presented to them in all his savage unrestraint.
He did exactly what Tennyson did, when
he made King Arthur the model of a modern English
gentleman and (by implication) a Protestant
a thousand years before Protestantism existed.
Ingeborg, too, had to be a trifle modified and disembarrassed
of a few somewhat too naturalistic
traits with which the saga endows her, before she
became the lovely type that she is of the faithful,
loving, long-suffering, womanhood of the North,
with trustful blue eyes, golden hair, and a heart
full of sweet and beautiful sentiment. It was
because Oehlenschl&auml;ger had neglected to make
sufficient concessions to modern demands that his
"Helge" (though in some respects a greater poem
than "Frithjof's Saga") never crossed the boundary
of Scandinavia, and even there made no deep
impression upon the general public.</p>

<p>Though the story of "Frithjof" is familiar to
most readers, I may be pardoned for presenting a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
brief <i>r&eacute;sum&eacute;</i>. The general plot, in Tegn&eacute;r's version,
coincides in its main outlines with that of the saga.
Frithjof, the son of the free yeoman Thorstein
Vikingson, is fostered in the house of the peasant
Hilding, with Ingeborg, the daughter of King
Bel&euml; of Sogn. The King and the yeoman have
been life-long friends, and each has a most cordial
regard for the other.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"By sword upheld, King Bel&euml; in King's-hall stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beside him Thorstein Vikingson, that yeoman good,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His battle-friend with almost a century hoary,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And deep-marked like a rune-stone with scars of glory."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The yeoman's son and the king's daughter,
thrown into daily companionship in their foster-father's
hall, love each other; and Frithjof, after
the death of their fathers, goes to Ingeborg's
brothers, Helge and Halfdan, and asks her hand in
marriage. His suit is scornfully rejected, and he
departs in wrath vowing vengeance. The ancient
King Ring, of Ringerike, having heard of Ingeborg's
beauty, sends also ambassadors to woo her.
Her brothers make sacrifices in order to ascertain
the will of the gods. The omens are inauspicious,
and they accordingly feel compelled to decline the
King's offer.</p>

<p>Ingeborg is shut up in Balder's Grove, where
the sanctity of the temple would make it sacrilege
for any one to approach her. Frithjof, however,
braves the wrath of the god, and sails every night
across the fjord to a stolen rendezvous with his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
beloved. The canto called "Frithjof's Happiness,"
which is brimming over with a swelling redundance
of sentiment, is so cloyingly sweet that the
reader must himself be in love in order to enjoy
it. It is written in the key of the watch-songs of
the German minnesingers and the aubades of
Proven&ccedil;al troubadours. The Norse note is not
only wanting, but would never fit into that key:</p>

<p>The two following cantos, entitled "The Parting"
and "Ingeborg's Lament," though liable to
the same criticism as their predecessor, are, with all
their sentimental effusiveness, beautiful. No lover,
I fancy, ever found them redundant, overstrained,
spoiled by the lavish splendor of their imagery.
Tegn&eacute;r has accomplished the remarkable feat of
interveining, as it were, his academic rhetoric with
a blood-red humanity, and making the warm pulse
of experience throb through the stately phrases.</p>

<p>King Ring, incensed at the rejection of his suit,
declares war against Helge and Halfdan, who in
their dire need ask Frithjof's aid, which is promptly
refused. In order to be rid of him they then send
him on an expedition to the Orkneys, to collect a
tribute which is due to them from Earl Angantyr.
He entreats Ingeborg to flee with him; but she
refuses. She sees from Balder's Grove his good
ship Ellida breasting the waves and weeps bitter
tears at his loss:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i0">Stars, lend assistance, a shining<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pathway defining!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"With the spring doves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Frithjof will come, but the maiden he loves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cannot in hall or dell meet him,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Heart-broken, given by her brother<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unto another."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is perfectly in keeping with the character of
Norse womanhood in the saga age that Ingeborg
should refuse to defy her brother's authority by
fleeing with Frithjof and yet deeply mourn his departure
without her. The family feeling, the bond
of blood, was exceptionally strong; and submission
to the social code which made the male head
of the house the arbiter of his sister's fate was
bred in the bone. It is, therefore, perfectly natural
that, when King Ring has beaten her brothers
in battle, and exacted Ingeborg as the prize of victory,
she yields unmurmuringly to their decree.</p>

<p>Frithjof, in the meanwhile, distinguishes himself
greatly in the Orkneys by his strength and
prowess, gains Earl Angantyr's friendship, and returns
with the tribute. As he sails into the fjord,
a sight greets him which makes his heart quail.
Framnaes, his paternal estate, is burnt to the
ground, and the charred beams lie in a ruined heap
under the smiling sky. The kings, though they
had pledged their honor that they would not harm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
his property, had broken faith with him; and
Ingeborg, in the hope of gaining whom he had
undertaken the perilous voyage, was wedded to
King Ring. In a white-heat of wrath and sorrow
Frithjof starts out to call her perjured brothers
to account. He finds them in the temple in Balder's
Grove, preparing for the sacrifice. There he
flings the bag containing the tribute into King
Helge's face, knocking out his front teeth, and
observing on his wife's arm the ring with which
he had once pledged Ingeborg, he rushes at her
to recover it. The woman, who had been warming
the wooden image of Balder before the fire, drops,
in her fright, the idol into the flame. Frithjof
seizes her by the arm and snatches the ring from
her. In the general confusion that follows the
temple takes fire, and all attempts to quench the
flames are futile. In consequence of this sacrilege
Frithjof is outlawed at the <i>Thing</i> as a <i>vargr-i-v&eacute;um</i>,
<i>i.e.</i>, wolf in the sanctuary, and is forced to go
into exile. His farewell to his native land strikes
one as being altogether out of tune. The old
Norse viking is made to anticipate sentiments
which are of far later growth; but for all that
the verses are quite stirring:</p>

<p>Frithjof now roams for many years over the sea
as a viking, and gains much booty and honor. His
viking code, with its swift anapestic rhythm, has a
breezy melody which sings in the ear. It is an
attempt to embody the ethics of Norse warfare at
its best, and to present in the most poetic light the
rampant, untamable individualism of the ancient
Germanic paganism. In defiance of his friend
Bj&ouml;rn's advice, Frithjof, weary of this bootless chase
for glory and pelf, resolves to see Ingeborg once
more before he dies, and, disguised as a salt-boiler,
he enters King Ring's hall. There he sees his beloved
sitting in the high-seat beside her aged lord;
and the sorrow which the years had dulled revives
with an exquisite agony. He punishes with fierce
promptitude one of the King's men who insults
him; and his answer to the King's rebuke betrays
him as a man of rank and station. He then throws
away his disguise, without, however, revealing his
name, but Ingeborg instantly recognizes him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Then even to her temples the queen's deep blushes sped,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As when the northlight tinges the snow-clad fields with red,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And like two full-blown lilies on racking waves which rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With ill-concealed emotion so heaved her throbbing breast."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The king now invites the stranger, who calls
himself Thjof, to remain his guest during the
winter, and Frithjof accepts. He makes, however,
no approach to Ingeborg, with whom he scarcely
exchanges a single word. During a sleigh-ride on
the ice he saves, by a tremendous feat of strength,
the life of the king and queen. With the coming
of the spring preparations are made for a grand
chase, in which Frithjof participates.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Spring is coming, birds are twittering, forests leaf, and smiles the sun;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the loosened torrents downward singing to the ocean run;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glowing like the cheek of Freya, peeping rosebuds 'gin to ope,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in human hearts awaken love of life and joy and hope."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The canto called "The Temptation" contains
the most dramatic and altogether the most beautiful
situation in the poem. The old king, feigning
weariness, begs Frithjof to tarry with him alone,
while he takes a rest. Frithjof tries to dissuade
him, but in vain.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Then threw Frithjof down his mantle, and upon the green sward spread;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the ancient king, so trustful, laid on Frithjof's knee his head;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Slept as calmly as the hero sleepeth after war's alarms<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On his shield, calm as an infant slumbers in its mother's arms."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Then the temptation comes to Frithjof to slay
the old man who had stolen his bride; but after a
brief struggle he hurls his sword far away into the
forest.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Straight the ancient king awakens. 'Sweet has been my sleep,' he said.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Pleasant 'tis to sleep in shadow, guarded by a brave man's blade.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But where is thy sword, O stranger, lightning's brother, where is he?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who has parted one from other that should never parted be?'"<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Not a whit care I,' said Frithjof, 'I shall find a sword some day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sharp, O King, are tongues of falchions, words of peace they seldom say;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the steel dwell swarthy demons, demons strayed from Nifelhem,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No man's sleep to them is sacred, silver locks embitter them.'<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Youth, no moment have I slumbered, but to prove thee feigned to rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unproved men and weapons never trusts King Ring without a test.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou art Frithjof. I have known thee since thou first cam'st to my hall;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Much that thou hast hidden from me; from the first I guessed it all.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Soon after this interview the aged king feels
death approaching; and in order not to go to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
dark abode of Hela, he cuts death-runes upon his
breast and ascends to Odin's bright hall. But before
dying he gives Ingeborg to Frithjof, and makes
him the guardian of his son. The people, in <i>Thing</i>
assembled, glorying in Frithjof's great renown, desire,
however, to make him King's successor; but
he lifts the small boy above his head upon his shield
and proclaims him king. He returns home and
rebuilds Balder's temple, whereupon the sentence
of outlawry is removed, and he is reconciled to
Ingeborg's brothers and marries the beloved of his
youth.</p>

<p>The last canto, called "The Atonement," is
perhaps the most flagrant violation of historical
verisimilitude in the whole epic. A hoary priest
of Balder actually performs the wedding ceremony
in the restored temple, and pronounces a somewhat
unctuous wedding oration, which differs from those
which Tegn&eacute;r himself had frequently delivered
chiefly in the substitution of pagan for the Christian
deities. As a matter of fact, marriage was a
purely civil contract among the ancient Norsemen,
and had no association with the temple or the
priesthood, which, by the way, was no separate
office but a patriarchal function belonging to the
secular chieftainship. But Tegn&eacute;r's public were in
nowise shocked by anachronisms of this sort;
they probably rejoiced the more heartily in the
happiness of the reunited lovers, because their
marriage was, according to modern notions, so
"regular."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span></p>

<p>It was soon after his publication of "Frithjof's
Saga" that Tegn&eacute;r became Bishop of Wexi&ouml;. He
then removed from Lund and took up his residence
upon the estate Oestrabo, near the principal town
in his diocese. The great fame of his poem came
to him as a surprise; and he even undertook to
protest against it, declaring with perfect sincerity
that he held it to be undeserved. In letters to his
friends he never wearied of pointing out the
faults of "Frithjof" and his own shortcomings
as a poet. In a letter to the poet Leopold (August
17, 1825), who had praised the poem to the
skies, he argues seriously to prove that his admiration
is misplaced:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"My great fault in 'Frithjof' was not that I chose my
theme from the old cycle of sagas, but that I treated it in
a tone and with a manner which was neither ancient nor
modern, neither antiquarian nor poetical, but hovered, as it
were, on the boundary of both. For what does it mean to
treat a subject poetically if not this, to eliminate everything
which belongs to an alien and past age and now no longer
appeals to any heart? The hearts to which it once did appeal
are now all dust. Other modes of thought and feeling
are current. It is impossible to properly translate one age
into another. But to poetry nothing is really past. Poetry
is the beautifying life of the moment; she wears the colors
of the day; she cannot conceive of anything as dead....
But I am convinced that all poetic treatment of a
theme belonging to a past age demands its modernization;
and that everything antiquarian is here a mistake. This
holds good not only in regard to the northern tone but also
in regard to the Greek. Look, for instance, at Goethe's
'Iphigenie.' Who does not admire the beautiful, simple,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
noble, Hellenic form? And yet who has ever felt his soul
warmed by this image of stone?... No living spirit
has been breathed into these nostrils; the staring eyes gaze
upon me without life and animation; no heart beats under
the Hellenically rounded marble bosom. The whole is a
mistake, infinitely more beautiful than 'Frithjof,' but fashioned
according to the game principles of art. The Greeks
said that the Muse was the daughter of Memory; but this
refers only to the material, the theme itself, which is everywhere
of minor consequence. The question, then, is as to the
proper treatment. Where it tends toward the antiquarian it
misses the mark; it represents, like 'Frithjof,' only a restored
ruin."</p></div>

<p>This passage is by no means the only one in
which Tegn&eacute;r, with an utter absence of vanity or
illusion, judged his work and found it wanting.
There is no mock modesty in his manly deprecation
of the honors that were showered upon him; but
as a father knows best the faults of his child whom
he loves, so he knew the defects of his work, as
measured by his own high standard, and refused
to accept any more praise than was his due. Not
even the fact that Goethe expressed his admiration
of "Frithjof's Saga" could persuade him that he
was entitled to the extravagant homage which his
enthusiastic countrymen accorded him. There
were even times when he disclaimed the title of
poet. Whether he was forgotten a little sooner or
a little later, he said, was a matter of small moment.</p>

<p>"Speaking seriously," he writes in 1824 (accordingly
before the publication of "Frithjof"), "I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
have never regarded myself as a poet in the higher
significance of the word.... I am at best a
John the Baptist, who is preparing the way for
him who is to come."</p>

<p>He is always just and inclined to be generous in
his judgment of every one except himself. It is
necessary, however, after the year 1824, to make
due allowance for the terrible strain upon his mind
which disposed him to give violent and hyperbolical
expression to the mood of the moment. The
unhappy passion which he could at times smother,
but never subdue, went boring away into his heart
like a subterranean fire, consuming his vitals, and
occasionally breaking forth into a wild blaze. The
following reference to it, in his letter to Franz&eacute;n
(November 13, 1825), is very pathetic:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"It is to-day my forty-third birthday. I have thus long
since passed the highest altitude of life where the waters divide.
With every year one now becomes smaller and smaller;
one star is extinguished after another. And yet the sun
does not rise. One dies by degrees and by halves. Therefore
only children and youth ought to celebrate their birthdays
with joy; we who have passed into the valley of age,
which with every step is growing darker and chillier, are
right in celebrating them with&mdash;whims.... However,
this is not my only or my greatest affliction, I have had and
have others. But the night is silent and the grave is dumb,
and their sister, Sorrow, should be as they. Therefore&mdash;let
this suffice."</p>

<p>December 29th. "Alas, this old year! What I have suffered
in it no one knows, if not, perhaps, the Recorder beyond
the clouds. But I am indebted to this year. It has
been darker, but also more serious than all the others put<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
together. I have learned at my own expense what a human
heart can endure without breaking, and what power God has
deposited in a man under his left nipple. As I say, I am
under obligation to this year, for it has enriched me with
what is the real sinking fund of human wisdom and human
independence&mdash;a mighty, deeply rooted contempt for man....
My inner nature emerges from the crisis like the
hibernating bear from his den, emaciated and exhausted,
but happily with my ursine sinews well preserved; and by
and by some flesh will be growing on them again. It seems
to me that my old barbaric, Titanic self, with its hairy arms,
is constantly more and more rubbing the sleep out of its
eyes. I hope that some vine may still grow upon the
scorched and petrified volcano of my heart."</p>

<p>January, 1826. "But when one is compelled to despise the
<i>character</i> of a human being, especially of one who has been
or is dear to one, then that is the bitterest experience which
life can afford; then it is not strange if a frank and ardent
soul turns with loathing from this false, hypocritical generation
and shuts himself up, as well as may be, in the hermitage
of his own heart.</p>

<p>"My mind is unchristian, for it has no day of rest. Generally
I think that my disease has its seat in the abdomen
or in the waist. Mineral waters I can no more drink this
summer. But is there not a mineral water which is called
Lethe?</p>

<p>"Whether my little personality returns thither whence it
came, with or without consciousness, a few months later or
earlier, in order to be drowned in its great fountain-head, or
to float for some time yet like a bubble, reflecting the clouds
and an alien light&mdash;this appears to me constantly a matter of
less and less consequence."</p></div>

<p>There is to me a heartrending pathos in these
confessions. It is easy to stand aloof, of course,
like a schoolmaster with his chastising rod, and lash<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
the frailties of poor human nature. It is easy to
declare with virtuous indignation that the man
who covets his neighbor's wife is a transgressor who
has no claim upon our sympathy. And yet who can
help pitying this great, noble poet, who fought so
bravely against his "barbaric, Titanic self with
its hairy arms"? His passionate intensity of soul
was, indeed, part of his poetic equipment; and he
would not have been the poet he was if he had
been cool, callous, and self-restrained. The slag in
him was so intimately moulded with the precious
metal that their separation would have been the
extinction of the individuality itself. The fiery
furnace of affliction through which he passed
warped and scorched and cracked this mighty compound,
but without destroying it. A glimpse of
this experience which transformed the powerful,
joyous, bright-visaged singer into a bitter, darkly
brooding pessimist, fleeing from the sinister shadow
which threatened to overtake him, is afforded us
in the poem "Hypochondria<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a>":</p>

<p>A physical disease which seems to have baffled
the skill of physicians may have been the primary
cause of the sufferings here described, and was no
doubt aggravated by the psychical condition to
which I have alluded. Now it was supposed to be
the liver which was affected; then again Tegn&eacute;r was
treated for gall-stones. In the summer of 1833 he
made a journey through Germany and spent some
months at Carlsbad; but he returned without sensible
relief. His foreign sojourn was, however,
of some benefit in widening his mental horizon.
Tegn&eacute;r's intellectual affinities had always been
French; and toward Germany he had assumed a
more or less unsympathetic attitude. A slight acquaintance
with the philosopher Schleiermacher
and the Germanized Norwegian author Henrik
Steffens (who was then a professor at the University
of Berlin) did not, indeed, reverse his predilections,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
but it opened his eyes to excellences in
the German people to which he had formerly been
blind, and removed prejudices which had obscured
his vision. He had everywhere the most
distinguished reception, and was honored with an
invitation to Sans Souci, where he was the guest of
the witty Crown Prince of Prussia, later Frederick
William IV. But these agreeable incidents of his
journey were a poor compensation for his failure
to obtain that which he had gone in search of.
Fame, honor, and distinguished friends, without
health, are but a Tantalus feast, the sweets of
which are seen but never tasted.</p>

<p>"I fear," said Tegn&eacute;r, in his hopelessness,
"that my right side, like that of the Chamber of
Deputies, is incurable."</p>

<p>"When this Saul's spirit comes over me I often
feel an indescribable bitterness, which endures
nothing, spares nothing, in heaven or on earth. It
usually finds vent in misanthropic reflections, sarcasms,
and ideas which I have no sooner written
down than I repent of them."</p>

<p>The activity which he unfolded, even in the
midst of intolerable sufferings, was phenomenal.
He possessed an energy of will and vigor of temperament
which enabled him to rise superior to
his physical condition, and lure strong music
(though sometimes jarred into discords) from the
broken lyre. It was in 1829, after his illness had
fastened its hold upon him, that he pronounced
the beautiful epilogue in hexameters at the graduating<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
festivities at the University of Lund, and
crowned the Dane, Adam Oehlenschl&auml;ger, as the
king of poets:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Now, before thou beginnest the distribution of laurels<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grant me one for him in whom I shall honor them all.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lo, the Adam of poets is here, the Northern king among singers;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Heir to the throne in poesy's world; for the throne yet is Goethe's.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oscar, the king, if he knew it, would give his grace to my action.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now I speak not for him, still less for myself, but the laurel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Place on thy brow in poesy's name, the bright, the eternal.<br /></span>
</div>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Past is disunion's age (in the infinite realm of the spirit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Never it ought to have reigned), and kindred tones o'er the water<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ring, which enrapture us all, and they are especially thine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Therefore, Svea&mdash;I speak in her name&mdash;adorns thee with laurel:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Take it from brotherly hand, of the day in festal remembrance."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Restless official activity, parliamentary labors,
educational addresses, and metrical discourses on
memorable occasions filled the years from 1829 to
1840. He felt the demon of insanity lurking behind
him, now close at his heels, now farther
away; and it was a desperate race, in which life
and death, nay, worse than death, was at stake.
His indefatigable exertions afforded him a respite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
from the thought of his terrible pursuer. We
can only regard with respectful compassion the
outbreaks of misanthropic spleen which often disfigure
his correspondence from this period of
deepening twilight, relieved by a brief interval of
brightness. It is especially woman who is the object
of his bitterest objurgation. The venerable
<i>mutabile et varium</i> of Virgil is the theme upon
which he perpetually rings the changes. No occasion
is too inappropriate for a joke at the fickle
and faithless sex; and even the school-boys in the
Wexi&ouml; gymnasium are treated to some ironical advice,
<i>&agrave; propos</i> of the beautiful jade, which must
have sounded surprising in an episcopal oration.
Life with its bright pageant was oppressive, like a
nightmare to the afflicted poet. All charm, all
rationality had departed from existence, which was
but a meaningless dance of hideous marionettes.
The world was battered and befouled; inexpressibly
loathsome. And finally, in 1840, while Tegn&eacute;r
was attending the Riksdag (of which in his official
capacity he was a member), the long-dreaded catastrophe
occurred. His insanity manifested itself in
tremendous projects of reform, world-conquests,
and outbreaks of wild sensuality. He was sent to
a celebrated asylum in Sleswick; and on the way
thither wrote a series of "Fantasies of Travel"
which have all the rich harmony of his earlier
verse, and are full of delightful imagery. He
fancied that there was a huge wheel of fire revolving
with furious haste in his head, and his sufferings<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span>
were terrific. The following fragment from
the notes of his attendant, who kept a record of
his ravings, has a cosmic magnificence:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The whole trouble comes from that accursed nonsense
about the diadem which they wanted to put on me. You
may believe, though, that it was a splendid piece. Pictures
in miniature, not painted, but living, really existing miniatures
of fourteen of the noblest poets were made into a
wreath. It was Homer and Pindar, Tasso and Virgil, Schiller,
Petrarch, Ariosto, Goethe, Sophocles, Leopold, Milton,
and several more. Between each one of them burned a radiant
star, not of tinsel, but of real cosmic material. In the
middle of my forehead there was the figure of a lyre on the
diadem, which had borrowed something of the sun's own
living light; it poured with such bright refulgence upon the
wreath of stars that I seemed to be gazing straight through
the world. As long as the lyre stood still, everything was
well with me&mdash;but all of a sudden it began to move in a circle.
Faster and ever faster it moved, until every nerve in
my body was shaken. At last it began to rotate in rings with
such speed that it was transformed into a sun. Then my
whole being was broken, and it moved and trembled; for
you must know that the diadem was no longer put on the
outside of my head, but inside, on my very brain. And now
it began to whirl around with an inconceivable violence, until
it suddenly broke and burst into pieces. Darkness&mdash;darkness&mdash;darkness
and night spread over the whole world wherever
I turned. I was bewildered and faint, and I who had
always hated weakness in men&mdash;I wept; I shed hot, burning
tears. All was over."<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a></p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_41_41" id="Footnote_41_41"></a><a href="#FNanchor_41_41"><span class="label">[41]</span></a> Brandes: Esaias Tegn&eacute;r, pp. 231-223.</p></div>

<p>Contrary to the expectation of his friends he recovered
rapidly, and was able to return home in
May, 1841. He promptly resumed his episcopal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span>
functions, and even wrote a beautiful rural idyl
in hexameters called "The Crowned Bride"
(<i>Kronbruden</i>), which he dedicated to Franz&eacute;n.
He was well aware, however, that his powers were
on the wane, and in 1845 he was persuaded to apply
for a year's relief from his official duties. The
last months of his life he spent mostly lying upon
a sofa in his library, surrounded by great piles of
books containing a most miscellaneous assortment
of classics, from Homer to Goethe, intersprinkled
with controversial pamphlets and recent novels.
He was gentle and affectionate in his demeanor; and
his beautiful face lighted up with a smile whenever
any of his children or grandchildren approached
him. Once or twice a day he drove out in his carriage,
and he was even able to visit his eldest son,
who was a clergyman in Scania, and to receive the
sacrament for the last time from his hand. Shortly
after his return he was stricken with paralysis,
and died November 2, 1846, in the sixty-fourth
year of his age. His mind was unclouded and his
voice was clear. When the autumnal sun suddenly
burst through the windows and shone upon the
dying poet, he murmured: "I will lift up mine
hands unto the house and the mountain of God."</p>

<p>These were his last words. He was carried to
the grave at night by the light of lanterns, followed
by a long procession of the clergy, citizens,
and the school-boys of his diocese. Peasants, from
whose ranks he had sprung and to whom he was
always a good friend, bore his coffin.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span></p>

<p>The academic tendency which "idealizes" life
and shuns earth-scented facts, had, through the
decisive influence of Tegn&eacute;r, been victorious in
Swedish literature. I am aware that some will
regard this as a questionable statement; for the
academicism of Tegn&eacute;r is not the stately, bloodless,
Gallic classicism of the Gustavian age, of
which Leopold was the last representative. It is
much closer to the classicism of Goethe in "Iphigenia"
and "Hermann and Dorothea," and of
Schiller in "Wallenstein" and "Wilhelm Tell."
Tegn&eacute;r's poetic creed was exactly that of Schiller,
who saw no impropriety in making the peasant
lad, Arnold Melchthal, when he hears that his
father has been blinded, deliver an enraptured
apostrophe to the light:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O eine edle Himmelsgabe ist<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Das Licht des Auges," etc.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The rhetorical note is predominant in both.
Their thoughts have to be arrayed in the flowing
toga before they are held to be presentable. This
is the academic tendency in Sweden as in France,
even though the degree of euphemistic magniloquence
may differ with the age and latitude. The
Swedes have been called the Frenchmen of the
North, and there is no doubt that delight in this
toga-clad rhetoric is inherent in both. It was because
Tegn&eacute;r, in appealing to this delight, was so
deeply representative that he extinguished the old
school and became the national poet of Sweden.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span></p>

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
